The front text guard is in situ and visible under the front pastedown, folded around the first gathering, with its text illegible. The back text guard, which was under the back pastedown and which was folded around the last gathering, was extracted after the acquisition of the manuscript by the University of Kansas, leaving offset onto the inside of the back board. The extracted text guard is now kept in a folder with the codex. The repurposed parchment used for the back text guard comes from the middle of a leaf, currently measuring 300 x 63 mm, and is probably dated to the ninth century. It contains an unidentified text, possibly a commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, with what was the upper side beginning with ""//cum omni malicia in cor//"". Written in Caroline minuscule, in 32 long lines, with sentence initials in alternating red and brown.|The manuscript comes from the library of the Dominican Monastery in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany (Dominikanerkloster Schwäbisch Gmünd), now converted into a cultural center, Prediger Kulturzentrum.

Ownership inscription in ink by a different contemporary hand on lower margin of folio 1r: ""Iste liber p[er]tinet conventui Gamu[n]diensi ord[in]is fr[atru]m p[re]dicatoru[m]."" The manuscript seems to have left Germany at the beginning of the nineteenth century and came into the possession of Thomas Thorpe, listed by him for sale in 1831 in London. Nineteenth-century? handwritten description of the manuscript pasted on the front pastedown, perhaps belonging to Thomas Thorpe. About a hundred years later, the manuscript was listed for sale in 1924 by the Anderson Galleries based in the United States together with the rest of the collection of Samuel H. Putnam. Within a decade, the manuscript was in the collection of Estelle Getz (neé: Estelle Kohn). Listed as no. 24 under ""The Library of Mrs. Milton E. Getz, 1007 Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, California"" in the Census of Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the United States and Canada. It was sold by Mrs. Getz through the American Art Association-Anderson Galleries in 1936.

Listed as ""OO 89"" in the seventeenth-century shelflist of the library, Cologne, Historisches Archiv der Stadt Köln, Best. 233 Kartäuser, Repertorien und Handschriften, Nr. 14. After the dissolution of the Charterhouse of St Barbara in Cologne in 1794, some of the manuscripts in its library were sold. During these sales, some hundred and thirty-six manuscripts were acquired by Johann Matthias Heberle (Antiquargeschäft mit Auktionsanstalt Cologne) and then sold in 1821 to Leander van Ess (Johann Heinrich van Ess). MS C91 was one of these manuscripts. In 1824, Leander Van Ess sold the manuscripts along with others that formerly belonged to the Charterhouse of St Barbara to Sir Thomas Phillipps. It is inscribed ""Phillipps MS 646"" in ink at center on recto of first front flyleaf and in the lower margin of folio 2r. Listed as no. 646 under ""Catalogus Bibliothecae Manuscriptorum Leandri van Ess, S. T. D."" in The Phillipps Manuscripts. After his death, Sir Thomas Phillipps's library was inherited by Katherine Fenwick, his daughter, and later passed on to Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick, his grandson. In 1910, the manuscript was sold by Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick to J. & J. Leighton in a Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge auction of Phillipps manuscripts. In 1912, the manuscript was purchased from J. & J. Leighton by Robert Ranshaw. Bookseller marks in pencil on inside of the front and back covers.",,2023-09-01 16:34:07 -0400,2022-01-13,20230815-kansas-marcxml.xml

Major imperfections on parchment, including holes and knife wounds as well as yellowing. The quality and thickness of the parchment varies throughout the manuscript. Several leaves are repurposed and palimpsest, with remnants of earlier texts partly visible on folios 64, 65, 66, 67. Evidence of sewn tabs along the fore-edge, corresponding to the beginning of books on folios 32, 55, 69, 78, 81, 84, 89, 109, 115, 125, 137, 182, 199, 210. Contemporary interlinear corrections and marginal additions, including the use of technical signs such as asteriscus, cryphia and require, probably by the scribe. Nota signs, some of which are decorated and in red, throughout, also probably by the scribe. Few modern marginal annotations by at least two hands, including a sign that resembles a trefoil.|The copy of the Aurora by Peter Riga in this manuscript is the so-called third edition of the work except that it does not contain the book titled ""Recapitulationes"" according to the modern edition (Aurora. Petri Rigae Biblia versificata: A Verse Commentary on the Bible. Ed. Paul. E. Beichner. Publications in Mediaeval Studies 19. 2 vols. Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1965).

The correct order of the folios for the first book of the Aurora (the ""Liber Genesis"") are as follows: folios 7r-10v (""[incipit] Si firmo sensu sc[ri]pta notare velis ... [explicit] Scia q[ui]ppe noce[n]t anim[a]e p[ro]dest labor illi.""), folios 5r-6v (""[incipit] H[ec] mala m[u]lta move[n]t h[ic] bona m[u]lta parit ...

[rubric] Explicit lib[er] genesis.""). Folio 183r is blank; the text breaks off at the end of folio 182v (""Actus Apostolorum,"" line 30) and resumes on folio 183v with no missing text, either a sign of miscalculation during the copying of the manuscript or due to the fragile nature of that particular leaf.|The manuscript comes from the library of the Charterhouse of Notre-Dame de Montrieux (Chartreuse de Montrieux) in Méounes-les-Montrieux, France according to a note in a modern hand on paper with a printed letterhead ""Ministère de la Guerre"" pasted over the front pastedown: ""Ce manuscrit qui faisait partie de la bibliothéque de l'ancienne Chartreuse de Montrieux (Monsrivus) dans le d[é]p[artemen]t du Var a été offert à M.

Blind-tooling on front and back cover, featuring a series of double-lined rhombuses. Most of the leather on the front board is destroyed, seemingly due to bookworm damage, and the spine is partly exposed. A rectangular paper label, covering most of the middle of the spine, with a handwritten inscription in ink ""No. XXXX / CXXXVI"" and with remnants of a red wax seal. A spiked round paper label adhered to the lower part of the larger rectangular label, with a handwritten inscription in ink: ""4o / 74529 / S.III.0.""|Origin: Probably written in Italy in the fifteenth century.|Former shelfmark: MS Y111.|Shelfmark: Lawrence, University of Kansas, Kenneth Spencer Research Library, MS C54.|In good condition except for yellowing and foxing on paper throughout, especially on the outer edges of the leaves.

Guide letters visible to the left of initials on most folios.|Binding: Contemporary, possibly original. Bound in dark brown quarter leather and wooden boards, with four alum-tawed slit straps with single herringbone sewing laced through channels. Evidence of a closure structure, most likely a single long pin strap hinging from the back cover, with all components lost. Front board worn. Some of the leather on the spine is destroyed, leaving the spine and especially the sewing supports exposed. Six paper labels adhered to spine from head to tail in the following order: a rectangular label with a typeset number ""59"" corrected to ""259"" by adding 2 in ink; a rectangular label with typeset letters ""OO""; remnants of two rectangular labels; a rectangular label with a typeset number ""644"" corrected to ""642"" by crossing out 4 and replacing it with 2 in pencil; a round label with a handwritten number ""497"" in ink.|Origin: Probably written in the Charterhouse of St Barbara in Cologne, Germany in the fifteenth century.|Former shelfmark: MS Y122|Former shelfmark: Phillipps MS 642|Related shelfmark: Cologne, Historisches Archiv der Stadt Köln, Best. 233 Kartäuser, Repertorien und Handschriften, Nr. 14|Shelfmark: Lawrence, University of Kansas, Kenneth Spencer Research Library, MS C64|In good condition except for minor bookworm damage at the tail of the first two quires and at the head of the fifth quire near the spine-folds which caused paper to tear, especially worse in the first quire. Approximately 15 mm of parchment is cut out of the head of the front flyleaf and approximately 20 mm of paper is cut out of the tail of the first folio. The latter seems to have contained an inscription, possibly that of an ownership. Signs of early repairs on paper. The spine-fold of the first gathering is supported by an approximately 18 mm parchment strip adhered to the outermost leaves. In the remaining gatherings, the center-folds are supported by approximately 15 mm parchment strips that are adhered to the innermost leaves of each quire. Most of the parchment strips, seemingly coming from different manuscripts, are repurposed and contain texts (unidentified). Ten parchment tabs adhered to the outer edges of leaves, corresponding to folios 1, 10, 19, 25 (now torn together with the paper to which it was adhered and lost), 30, 40, 45, 56, 73, 82. A number of contemporary marginal annotations, mostly by the scribe.|The front pastedown and the flyleaf are made up of a single repurposed parchment leaf folded in half. The recto side (now the pastedown and the recto of the flyleaf) contains De viris illustribus urbis Romae / Pseudo-Sextus Aurelius Victor [incomplete; chapters 75-77]: ""[acephalous] [incipit] accepit bello Tymbrico et Teutonico legat[us] bona[m] op[er]am manavit [sic] .... [explicit] Qui no[n] [con]ti[nens] lac[ri]mas illud plurimis [et] p[re]ciosissim[is] [o]dorib[us] cremandu[m] curavit."" The outer margin of the leaf (now the tail edge of the pastedown and the flyleaf) is trimmed, with some loss of text. Probably dated to the fifteenth century and written in Gothic cursive, in two columns of 46 lines, below topline; frame ruled in lead, with full-length double vertical and horizontal bounding lines. The verso of the front flyleaf (originally blank) contains the table of contents of the manuscript, amended by later hands.|The manuscript comes from the library of the Charterhouse of St. Barbara in Cologne, Germany (Kölner Kartause). Sixteenth-century shelfmark of the library inscribed in ink in upper right corner on folio 1r: ""g.22."" Seventeenth-century label of the library adhered to head of spine: ""OO."" Listed as ""OO 134"" in the seventeenth-century shelflist of the library, Cologne, Historisches Archiv der Stadt Köln, Best. 233 Kartäuser, Repertorien und Handschriften, Nr. 14. After the dissolution of the Charterhouse of St. Barbara in Cologne in 1794, some of the manuscripts in its library were sold. During these sales, some hundred and thirty-six manuscripts were acquired by Johann Matthias Heberle (Antiquargeschäft mit Auktionsanstalt Cologne) and then sold in 1821 to Leander van Ess (Johann Heinrich van Ess). MS C64 was one of these manuscripts. In 1824, Leander Van Ess sold the manuscript along with others that formerly belonged to the Charterhouse of St. Barbara to Sir Thomas Phillipps. It is inscribed ""Phillipps MS 642"" in ink at center on verso of front flyleaf and there is a rectangular Phillipps label with a typeset number ""644"" corrected to ""642"" adhered to tail of spine. Listed as no. 642 under ""Catalogus Bibliothecae Manuscriptorum Leandri van Ess, S. T. D."" in The Phillipps Manuscripts. After his death, Sir Thomas Phillipps's library was inherited by Katherine Fenwick, his daughter, and later passed on to Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick, his grandson. In 1910, the manuscript was sold by Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick to J. & J. Leighton in a Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge auction of Phillipps manuscripts. The round label with a handwritten number ""497"" in ink adhered to tail of spine probably belongs to this auction. In 1911, the manuscript was purchased from J. & J. Leighton by Jacques Rosenthal. Bookseller marks in pencil on front pastedown and recto of second back flyleaf.",,2023-09-01 16:34:07 -0400,2021-12-23,20230815-kansas-marcxml.xml

It contains Isidore of Seville's Sententiae, Book 10.11 ""De angelis"" and a sermon titled ""De misericordia"" attributed to John Chrysostom, also known by its opening words, ""Tria sunt quae in misericordiae opera."" The upper margin of the bifolium (now the fore-edge turn-in of the front cover) is trimmed with no loss of text, with all edges of the cover left large enough to allow for turn-ins. Written in late Caroline minuscule, in two columns of 38 lines, ruled in drypoint.|The repurposed parchment folio used for the front flyleaves likely comes from an antiphonary, probably dated to the first half of the twelfth century. It contains John 6:1-14 and the following chants: ""Tunc acceptabis sacrificium justitiae si averteris faciem tuam"" [Cantus ID: 005236]; ""Aperiam in parabolis os meum loquar propositiones"" [Cantus ID: g01030b]; ""Adduxi vos per desertum quadraginta annos"" [Cantus ID: 006030]; ""Adduxit eos dominus in fortitudine magna cibavit"" [Cantus ID: 006032]. The upper margin of the leaf (now the outer edge of the first front flyleaf) is trimmed, with at least two lines of text lost. Outer and inner margins of the leaf are also trimmed, with some text lost on the outer margin (now the tail-edge). 18-line interlace initial I? in red and brown (partly cut off); rubrics in red. Written in Praegothica, in two columns of 34? lines, ruled in drypoint.|The repurposed parchment folio used for the back flyleaves likely comes from a breviary, probably dated to the first half of the twelfth century. It contains readings associated with Maundy Thursday and Good Friday of the Christian Holy Week. The recto side (now the recto side of the first back flyleaf and the verso side of the second back flyleaf) contains: Hosea 6:5-6 (""[incipit] [do]lui [?] in p[ro]phetis occidi eos in verbis oris mei ... [explicit] scientiam D[e]i plus quam holocausta.""); Habakkuk 3:2-3: (""[incipit] Domine audivi auditum tuum [et] timui...

The upper margin of the leaf (now the outer edge of the second back flyleaf) is trimmed, with one line of text lost. 15-line zoomorphic white wine-stem initial I in red, green, blue and brown, with an eagle holding a book, representing St John; 4-line initial I in red and green; rubrics in red. Written in late Caroline minuscule, in two columns of 31 lines, ruled in drypoint.|In fragile condition, with extensive water damage that caused yellowing and staining of the leaves throughout the manuscript. Ink is abraded, with text illegible at places. Tears and holes with loss of text on several folios. Only the third quire is in relatively better condition. Minor imperfections and signs of early repairs on parchment of the textblock. The repurposed parchment leaves used for the cover and the flyleaves are cockled, with minor bookworm damage. Corrections, overwriting and annotations, including the use of technical signs such as trigons by at least two contemporary hands, one of which is probably the scribe. Later (fifteenth century?) annotations, especially on folios 19r-33r, by at least two hands. Some of the annotations on upper margins are lost due to damage to the parchment.|Early history of the manuscript is unknown. From the collection of Alpha Loretta Owens, who purchased the manuscript sometime before 1935, probably in one of her visits to Europe. Listed as no. 1 under ""The Library of Miss Alpha Loretta Owens, Barboursville, West Virginia"" in the Census of Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the United States and Canada.",,2023-09-01 16:34:07 -0400,2021-11-24,20230815-kansas-marcxml.xml

There is no modern edition of the Abbreviatio summae Guillelmi Altissiodorensis. A comparison of the text contained in MS B18 with those of other known manuscripts leads to the conclusion that only the very end of the work, which was on the final leaf of the codex, is missing.|The endleaves of MS B18 are made up of repurposed parchment leaves, possibly two consecutive leaves from the same manuscript, likely a breviary, probably dated to the fifteenth century: a folio cut to size and folded in half is used for the front pastedown and flyleaf and another for the back flyleaf and pastedown. Both leaves contain chants, most of which are associated with the Christian Feast of the Holy Innocents: front pastedown and flyleaf: ""Hi sunt qui cum mulieribus"" [Cantus ID: 003044]; ""Hi empti sunt ex hominibus"" [Cantus ID: 006273b]; ""In conspectu agni amicti stolis"" [Cantus ID: 007012a]; ""Effuderunt sanguinem"" [Cantus ID: 006624]; ""Et cantabant quasi canticum novum"" [Cantus ID: 006617z.1]; ""Audivi vocem de caelo tamquam"" [Cantus ID: 006153]; back flyeaf and pastedown: ""Isti sunt sancti qui non"" [Cantus ID: 007021]; Ambulabunt mecum in albis [Cantus ID: 001364]; Hi sunt qui cum mulieribus"" [Cantus ID: 003044]; Ambulabunt mecum in albis [Cantus ID: 001364]; ""Isti sunt qui non inquinaverunt"" [Cantus ID: 007021]; ""Adoraverunt viventem in"" [Cantus ID: 006050]; ""Et ceciderunt in conspectu"" [Cantus ID: 006050b]; ""Ecce vidi agnum stantem supra"" [Cantus ID: 006617]. All margins are trimmed, with some loss of text. Initials in red with purple flourishing and blue with red flourishing. Written in Gothic rotunda, in 9 long lines and 9 four-line staffs. Ruled in lead, with double vertical bounding lines.|In good condition despite missing and damaged leaves. Lower margins of folios 2 and 175 excised, with no loss of text. Major imperfections on parchment and signs of early repairs, some of which are probably from when the parchment was prepared and some of which are by sewing. Leaves are of uneven sizes, with many leaves untrimmed and edges of skins present, especially on the fore-edge and the tail-edge. Ink smears on a number of leaves. Few marginal and interlinear corrections by a contemporary hand in a different ink. Marginal technical signs and annotations in lead throughout.|The manuscript comes from the library of the Charterhouse of Notre-Dame-du-Val-de-Bénédiction in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, France (Chartreuse du Val de bénédiction). Two late medieval ownership inscriptions in ink: ""Iste liber e[st] vallis b[e]n[e]dicc[i]o[n]is de villa nova ordinis Cartusien[sis] p[ro]pe Avinionem"" in the lower margin on folio 71r and ""Vallis benediccionis ord[in]is Ca[r]tusien[sis]"" in the upper margin on folio 111r.

Only the beginnings of Book II and Book III are signaled in the manuscript in the upper margins of folio 8r and folio 14r respectively. Book IV is missing the fourth, fifth and sixth stanzas due to a scribal error or a defective exemplar.|The copy of La sfera in this manuscript was transcribed by a team of ten scholars (Isabella Bolognese, Marguerite Bordry, Karen Severud Cook, Alyssa Granacki, Sunny Harrison, Liz Hebbard, Laura Ingallinella, Monica Keane, Agnieszka Rec, N.

Reported to be from the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps (Phillipps MS 3542) but there is no ownership mark of Phillipps on the manuscript.

Purchased by H. P. Kraus in the 1966 Sotheby's sale, when the manuscript was listed as having 64 leaves. The remaining portion of this manuscript is now Notre Dame, University of Notre Dame, Hesburgh Library, cod. Lat. c. 11, sold to them in September 1967 also by H. P. Kraus.

Evidence of a paper text-hook flyleaf, which might have been pasted on to the front board, with its stub also present preceding the parchment text guard stub at the end of the first gathering. Remnants of paper (potentially pastedowns) on turn-ins on the insides of both boards. The center-folds of all gatherings are supported by approximately 14 mm parchment strips that are adhered to the innermost leaves of each quire. The parchment strips are all repurposed fragments, possibly from the same manuscript, with text which remain unidentified. Folios 71 and 72 are torn on the fore-edge, with no loss of text. Deckle edges visible on the tail-edge in Part 4. Few marginal corrections by contemporary hands.|The manuscript comes from the library of the Charterhouse Aula Beatae Mariae in Buxheim near Memmingen, Germany (Reichskartause Buxheim). Ownership inscription in the upper margin on folio 1r: ""Buxheim"" with a preceding encircled cross. Eighteenth-century label of the library with the contemporary shelfmark of the manuscript adhered to tail of spine: ""348."" MS E35 is probably the same volume which is listed under letter B, number 12 in the earliest register of the library dated to the mid-fifteenth century, Berlin, Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Ms. lat. qu. 372, folio 17r. After the secularization of the Buxheim Charterhouse in 1802/1803, the estate along with the library passed on to private hands; first to the Counts of Ostein and then to those of Waldbott von Bassenheim. Carthusians remained on site until 1812. The holdings of the library was auctioned off in Munich in 1883 by Carl Förster and in 1884 and 1885 by Ludwig Rosenthal, who had also purchased most of Förster's stock. The manuscript was listed for sale by Ludwig Rosenthal at least on two occasions, first in 1885 and later in 1910. It is not known whether the manuscript changed hands or remained in the Rosenthal family for nearly 75 years. In 1959, the manuscript was listed for sale by Bernard Rosenthal, Ludwig Rosenthal's grandnephew, from whom the University of Kansas acquired the manuscript. Bookseller marks in pencil on recto of front flyleaf by different hands, including ""Ms. 212,"" ""Nider 14323"" and a price.

Only the beginnings of Book VII (folio 37r), Book VIII (folio 49v) and Book IX (folio 61r) are present.|Early history of the manuscript is uncertain. The manuscript was purchased from Payne & Foss by Sir Thomas Phillipps (Phillipps MS 12281) in 1848 (or 1847). It is inscribed ""Phillipps MS 12281"" in ink on folio 1r. Listed as no. 12281/22 under ""Payne & Foss, 1848"" and reported to have come from the Abbey of Santo Stefano in Fossanova (""ex Abb. S. Stephani de, Nova Fossa"") in The Phillipps Manuscripts. The Fossanova provenance is contested and uncertain. After his death, Sir Thomas Phillipps's library was inherited by Katherine Fenwick, his daughter, and later passed on to Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick, his grandson. This manuscript was probably among those inherited; however, there is no known record of it in the subsequent sales from the Phillipps library. There is a spiked round paper label adhered to the tail of spine that belongs to an unidentified owner with a handwritten inscription: ""S II F // Virgilius [underlined] // Ms. XV // fol. 20400."" Inscription by a different, modern hand in ink on spine, below gold-tooled title: ""1200/1300 Approx 1300.""

The end of the text on folio 35v is arranged as a tailpiece (an inverted triangle, with the margins gradually increasing).|Binding: Early modern. Contemporary to the manuscript, possibly original, probably made in the mid-sixteenth century in a workshop in Rome, Italy. Bound in full leather dyed dark red, gold-tooled with wide floral frames made by a panel stamp and featuring painted shield of Dominicus Capranica at the center of both covers. Five raised bands.

Maioli, Canevari and Others (Boston, MA: Little, Brown, and Company, 1926). Six printed (?) paper (?) strips adhered to the spine to reinforce the attachment of the cover to the bookblock are partly visible underneath pastedowns on both sides. Signs of early repairs on corners and head and tail of spine. Two paper labels adhered to tail of spine: a round label with a handwritten number ""1230"" and a rectangular label, placed partly on top of the other, with a typeset number ""8274"" [see provenance].|Origin: Probably written in Rome, Italy in mid-sixteenth century.|Former shelfmark: Phillipps MS 8274|Shelfmark: Lawrence, University of Kansas, Kenneth Spencer Research Library, MS C247|In relatively good condition despite water damage and staining on the first few leaves and ink smears on a few leaves. Staining on pastedowns from turn-ins. Frontispiece exhibits extensive abrasion and some pigment loss. Very few corrections. Doodle of a man with a sword on the lower half of folio 36r.|The manuscript perhaps originally was commissioned by a member of the Capranica family or by the library of the Almo Collegio Capranica in Rome, based on the frontispiece with the coat of arms of Dominicus Capranica and the binding featuring his shield. Soon after, in the second half of the sixteenth century, the manuscript was probably in the possession of Rinaldo Ridolfini, a lawyer in Perugia, Italy, based on an inscription on folio 2r: ""Ranaldus Ridolfinus."" The manuscript was purchased in Perugia in 1822 by Frederick North, the 5th Earl of Guildford: his bookplate pasted on front pastedown (folio 1v) and two almost identical inscriptions, presumably by him: ""e libris F. Com. de Guilford empt. Perusia A. D. 1822"" on folio 1v and ""e libris Friderici Com. de Guilford empt. Perusia AD. 1822"" on folio 2r. The manuscript was later in the collection of Richard Heber, presumably acquired in the 1830 auction of Frederick North's manuscripts by R. H. Evans. There is a round paper label with a handwritten number ""1230"" adhered to the tail of the spine; 1230 was the lot number of this manuscript in the 1836 auction of Heber's manuscripts. The manuscript was purchased by Payne & Foss for Sir Thomas Phillipps (Phillipps MS 8274) in the 1836 auction of Heber's manuscripts. It is inscribed ""8274"" in blue crayon on folio 2r and there is a rectangular Phillipps label with a typeset number ""8274"" adhered to tail of spine. The manuscript is also inscribed ""Heber"" in pencil on folio 1v by Sir Thomas Phillipps. Listed as no. 8274/1230 under ""Heber Mss"" in The Phillipps Manuscripts. The manuscript was auctioned by Sotheby & Co. in 1968 and was purchased by Hofmann & Freeman Antiquarian Booksellers.",,2023-09-01 16:34:07 -0400,2021-07-28,20230815-kansas-marcxml.xml

Water damage (with no loss of text) on the lower part of the manuscript, especially worse in quires 17 to 19. The center-folds are supported by approximately 8 mm parchment or paper strips, some of which are repurposed, that are adhered to the innermost leaves of each gathering. Evidence of earlier repairs on paper. Few additions and corrections by a contemporary hand. Several numbers and short annotations inscribed in pencil on the front pastedown, now mostly erased. Annotations on folio 1r as well as a small piece of paper glued, with inscription in ink: ""No. 28. Martial."" Ownership inscriptions on folio 186v.|Early history of the manuscript is unknown. In the early nineteenth century, the manuscript was first in the possession of Carlo Salvi and later in that of Luigi Celotti. According to Celotti's 1821 Sotheby's sale catalog, it came from either the collection of Matteo Luigi Canònici or that of Giovanni Saibante. The manuscript was later in the collection of Richard Heber, possibly purchased in Celotti's 1821 sale. It was then purchased by Thomas Thorpe in the 1836 auction of Heber's manuscripts. Ownership inscription on folio 186v: ""Thomas Thorpe."" Immediately after, also in 1836, the manuscript was purchased from Thomas Thorpe by Sir Thomas Phillipps (Phillipps MS 9677). It is inscribed ""Phillipps MSS 9677"" in ink at center on front pastedown and there are remnants of a rectangular Phillipps label with a typeset number, with only ""96"" remaining, adhered to the tail of spine. Listed as no. 9677 under ""Thorpe Mss. 1836"" in The Phillipps Manuscripts. After his death, Sir Thomas Phillipps's library was inherited by Katherine Fenwick, his daughter, and later passed on to Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick, his grandson. Initials of Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick inscribed in upper left corner of verso of back flyleaf: ""T.FF 1891."" The manuscript was sold by Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick at a Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge sale in 1895. It seems to have been purchased by Harold Baillie-Weaver in the 1895 sale. The manuscript was later purchased by Bernard Quaritch from Harold Baillie-Weaver in a Christie, Manson & Woods sale in March 1898. It appears in two of Quaritch's sale catalogs, first immediately after their purchase in 1898 (Catalogue no. 180, item no. 40) and then in 1902 (Catalogue no. 211, item no. 153). The manuscript seems to have been purchased in 1902 by Sir Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, only to be sold a year later in a Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge sale of his collection. The manuscript is listed again in a sale catalog of Bernard Quaritch in 1905 (Catalogue no. 240, item no. 232), presumably repurchased in the 1903 Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge sale. However, only two years later, in 1907, it is again listed by Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge (June 24, 1907, item no. 714) and this time it is sold to another bookseller, Francis Edwards Ltd., who listed the manuscript in their catalog in 1909 (item no. 679). The manuscript was later in the possession of E. P. Goldschmidt, listed by them for sale several times beginning in 1930 (Catalogue no. 23, item no. 8) until 1955. Unidentified inscriptions, perhaps by different hands, on folio 186v: ""Markham,"" ""Maria"" and ""John."" Possible bookseller marks, unidentified: several numbers and annotations on front pastedown; ""tn?"" inscribed in ink in upper right corner and ""#11607"" in pencil in lower right corner of back pastedown.",,2023-09-01 16:34:07 -0400,2021-11-24,20230815-kansas-marcxml.xml
