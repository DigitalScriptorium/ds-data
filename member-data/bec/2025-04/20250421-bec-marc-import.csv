Foliated, September 2023.Bound, possibly in former days, in limp vellum over boards, to the extent that there is with today's completely unbound book an outer shell of a limp vellum binding, but it is uncertain if this was ever attached to the present book, in that, sitting on the book's ""front"" and ''back"" areas, there is a dark vellum ""leaf"" that might have been part of this book's binding. The stitching of the book's gatherings is solid, holding the book in its present jumbled state, and placing the book's one leaf with its highest present level of decoration in first position (the opening of the O Intemerata prayer, with a 4-line initial and C-shaped page decoration).|Written in France, probably in Rouen, given the liturgical use of the Hours of the Virgin (at Prime; Nones no longer remains in the manuscript), during the middle of the 15th century. Probably during the 18th to 19th century, the book belonged to the family residing in Milton Hall, near Peterborough, given the book label on the front pastedown (but this attribution is made with some caution, since the shell of the binding might have belonged to another book). Not in De Ricci. Date of acquisition by the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library is unknown (but probably after the publication of De Ricci in 1935-40).","",2025-05-22 10:51:34 -0400,20231006,20250421-bec-marc.xml

In addition, the dark colors in the backgrounds of the painted initials is typical of work done at the end of the century. A slip from an auction catalogue is glued to the front pastedown of the first volume: it presumably was retained here because it represents this present manuscript, although the book of hours described on the slip is said to have 164 leaves (as opposed to the present ff. 72), with ""14 beautifully painted miniatures"" (there are 9 in the book as it now stands); in addition, this slip labels the manuscript it describes as n. 959 in its catalogue, suggesting a very large sale; the slip is assumed to come from an auction catalogue (rather than a sales catalogue) because there is no price associated with it (and the very top of the following entry is just barely visible at the bottom of the slip). The manuscript as it now stands, of 72 leaves, belonged to James Fraser Gluck (1852-1897); he had the book bound in its present red morocco, had the inscriptions placed on the front covers, and donated the now-two volumes (along with a large collection of materials relating to British and American authors) to the Buffalo Public Library in 1886, which is a very early date for interest in medieval manuscripts in the United States.|Calendar in red and black--V. 1, leaves [1-12].|Identified in De Ricci as Horae, Roman use, written in France.","",2025-05-22 10:51:34 -0400,20231220,20250421-bec-marc.xml
