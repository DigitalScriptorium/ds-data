The practice of writing music, as well as the practice of many arts, vanished after the fall of Rome.|Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman emperor (742-814) restored learning and education to the Western world and the empire over which he reigned. He implemented a standardization of written text and music throughout his empire, which extended through much of modern-day Western and Central Europe. The emperor employed Alcuin, a scholar from England, to run a school and scriptorium in Aix-la-Chapelle, Charlemagnes favored residence. The resulting, highly legible script was Caroline minuscule. A musical notation was developed, too, in the form of the so-called St. Gall notation, named after the abbey in St. Gall, modern-day Switzerland.|This leaf is written in Caroline minuscule, with unheightened or nondiastematic neumes. Neumes are the earliest notes used in plainchant, which is the monophonic unison chant of the Christian liturgies. Early on, they were squiggles and dots, like the ones displayed here. These neumes do not show the relative pitch between notes, and there is no indicated base pitch. None of these were necessary to the singer, however; the notation served as a reminder of the relative pitches to singers who would already have been familiar with the melody.|The text is 2 Corinthians 6:1-10, Exhortamur (vos) ne in vacuum gratiam Dei recipiatis. . . (We exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain), which is the Epistle of the Mass for the First Sunday in Lent. It is followed by Psalm 90, which is sung as the Gradual of the Mass: Angelis suis mandavit de te ut custodiant te in omnibus viis tuis. . . (God has given His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways).|Free Library of Philadelphia Lewis Text Leaf 3:85|The ancient Greeks had developed a system of musical notation that differentiated between instrumental and sung music, and even indicated rhythmic value.

The Proclamation would be intoned during the Easter Vigil, or the night before Easter Sunday.|Missals were usually in two-column format: most missals did not contain music. This leaf has been simply rubricated (initials drawn in blue and red ink for delineation and ease of reading). Additionally, it is clear that there are many erasures and rewritings of the music in this leaf. Erasing parchment involved scraping the page (which is animal skin) with pumice or other scraping tools. It is possible or even probable that the leaf was meant to be decorated in the borders and that it was never completed. This leaf and the other leaf in this case are wonderful artifacts that allow us to see some of the stages of manuscript preparation from the Middle Ages.|Script: Gothic bookhand",Contributor: David Kalish|Cataloger: Dot Porter|Funder: Council on Library and Information Resources,2023-12-03 20:08:22 -0500,2019-04-30,lewis_t637_TEI.xml

Each of the four pages presents, anonymously, part of a different Credo, which means that neither side of the bifolio was originally a centre gathering. Spacing suggests pages were ruled with 12 red staves (of which only the upper 7 survive), allowing each Credo to occupy a single opening, as in Old Hall (Lbl 57950). Two of the Credos have concordances with known compositions, supplying attributions: one to Dunstaple, the other to 'Anglicanus'. (These were identified by Peter Wright. See now EECM 55, nos 16, 45, 46). The numbering of the folios (A as the wider leaf and B the smaller) is provisional, as it is not entirely clear which way the bifolio was originally folded. All four pieces are in full black notation with red coloration.|f. Ar Anglicanus, Credo Alma redemptoris mater (= Curtis & Wathey, Credo 70: Tr92-1, 113v-114).
