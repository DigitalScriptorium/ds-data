In the narrative of Christ's Passion, the lamentation over Christ's dead body follows his deposition from the Cross. The Virgin is joined in her sorrow by other witnesses to the Crucifixion; in this initial John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus accompany her. Lamentation scenes such as this one formed the basis for the popular late medieval devotional image known as the Pietà, in which the Virgin mourns alone as she cradles Christ's body. Attavante degli Attavanti (b. 1452-1520/25) was one of Florence's most sought after illuminators of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Among his many patrons, were Federigo da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino (14778), and Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary (1458-1490).|This cutting can be dated to ca. 1520.|This image shows the reverse of a cutting with a decorated initial from a missal.|Script: Rotunda",Contributor: David Kalish|Cataloger: Dot Porter|Funder: Council on Library and Information Resources,2023-12-03 20:08:22 -0500,2019-04-29,lewis_e_m_025_009_TEI.xml

This image of the Trinity in which God the Father presents his Son crucified under the wings of the dove of the Holy Spirit, is also known as the Mercy-Seat Trinity. It emphasizes in sentimental terms the paternal nature of God and the human suffering of the Son, following certain tendencies in late medieval devotion to focus on the human nature of Christ.|Image shows the reverse of a cutting with a miniature from a choir book.|Script: Rotunda",Contributor: David Kalish|Cataloger: Dot Porter|Funder: Council on Library and Information Resources,2023-12-03 20:08:22 -0500,2019-04-29,lewis_e_m_028_020_TEI.xml

(God, who for the salvation of your faithful, had willed the body of the Blessed Nicholas to be transferred to Bari from Myra). St. Nicholas, whose legendary acts of charity led to his association with the gift-giving Santa Claus, lived in Myra, a town in modern-day Turkey, and died there in 346. His relics remained there until May 9, 1087, when several citizens of the Italian city of Bari took his bodily remains from Myra and brought them to Bari, where they can be found today. For various reasons that legends always purport to arise from divine providence, the bodies and relics of saints could be moved or 'translated' from one site to another. The day of a saint's translation is often celebrated as a feast day in the medieval calendar. The fact that St. Nicholas' translation is given special attention in this fragment may indicate that the original manuscript was intended for use in or around the town of Bari.|This image shows the reverse of a cutting with an historiated initial that begins the prayer for the celebration of the feast of the Translation of St. Nicholas of Myra (or Bari).
