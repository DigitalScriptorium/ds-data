The Doge of Venice was one of the most powerful among them. Dogali were used to transfer power to certain individuals, granting them various rights, responsibilities, and privileges. Although secular documents, the iconography of illuminated dogali was usually religious in nature to suggest the approval of divine authority. In this miniature, the recipient kneels before the Virgin and Child. Behind him are two saints. The first saint is St. Philip the Apostle, identified here by his cross. The other saint has been identified as St. Louis of Toulouse, to whom a Franciscan church in Venice called San Alvise (the Venetian dialect form of Louis) is dedicated. The illumination of this leaf and several others in the Free Library's collection (Lewis E M 47:5,6,9, 11, and 75:9) was executed in the workshop of a Venetian illuminator active from the 1520s to the 1570s.

F., after the initials are inscribed in another cutting by the same artist now in the Museo Diocesano in Lodi, Italy.
