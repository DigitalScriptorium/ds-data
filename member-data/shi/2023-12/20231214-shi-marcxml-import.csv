Noteworthy for its illustrations and full complement of tables and figures, it includes extensive annotations that call for further study. The text appears to be extremely uncommon on the market, and there is only one recorded copy in the United States.|The text itself is presented as a compendium of the secrets of nature already revealed in other works. The opening chapters are theoretical, and discuss the relationship between the microcosm and macrocosm, the bond of love uniting the world, the need for a reformatio materiae (a reformation of matter), that can be achieved by the true alchemist who receives illumination from God (themes also found in the Testamentum). A practical section begins with chapter twelve, and includes a detailed discussion of the four stages of the alchemical opus, described in terms of the generation of the human body.|The manuscript now consists of two parts of independent origins. The first quire, which includes the end of the text by Pseudo-Lull and diagrams, is dated 1472 on f. 10v; the evidence of the script and initials suggest an origin in northern Italy (note the abbreviation of ""qui"" especially), or perhaps in a neighboring region of Germany or Austria. The inscription below the picture of the furnace on f. 3v states, ""Dominus Comes Archi ex sua industria nomine fransciscus [sic] anno lxxii"" (presumably implying that the furnace was built by Francis, the Lord Count ""of Archus"" [?], from his industry in [14]72).|The second part of the manuscript includes the bulk of the Pseudo-Lull text from the beginning, breaking off incompletely where the first part picks up. It is copied in a good Italian cursive humanistic script, approaching Italic, certainly from the second half of the fifteenth century. Dating this section depends in part on the explanation of the origin of this codex. If the first section of the manuscript was copied to supply text missing at the end of this section, this second section must be earlier, i.e. before 1472. Although this is an attractive possibility (and the two sections were certainly brought together early in the manuscript's history, see below), given the contemporary foliation in the first section beginning with f. 27 (the second leaf is numbered f. 28, folio number on the first leaf now missing), it seems more likely that the manuscript was assembled from two pre-existing manuscripts of completely independent origins. This second explanation is also more in keeping with the script of the second section, which can more comfortably be dated from the last quarter of the fifteenth century, c. 1470-1500. The watermarks have not been identified, but further analysis might be helpful to establish the date and origin of both sections of this codex.|Clearly the two sections of the manuscript were brought together early in its history. Both sections are copiously annotated by a later reader (sixteenth-century?) who added occasional notes, rather abstract pointing hands, and underlined large sections of the text in black ink (cf. for example ff. 8v-9 and 63v-64). The wear on the two sections, however, is clearly independent - in particular the prominent staining in the upper outer margins of part two is lacking in part one.|Front flyleaf, f. ii verso, ""Bonaparte Carolos.

It includes more than 500 numbered and itemized recipes for dyes. Recipes are illustrated with more than 800 wool and fabric samples in colors ranging from dozens of shades of brown to vivid fuchsia, turquoise and mustard that are glued to the pages. Fabrics include wool, felt and cotton, and the glued-in samples include swatches of fabric and raw wool, and coils of yarn. Ingredients listed include mud, urine, arsenic, and vitriol. Pages [192]-[219] contain longer descriptions of dying processes, one attributed to Giacomo Udinese and another to Cesare Bizzi. There are loose sheets laid in between pages [64]-[65] and [94]-[95], and one tipped in between pages [136]-[137].|Title devised by cataloger from bookseller's description.|Place of creation based on language of item.

It includes only the first book of the Testamentum, which is largely theoretical in content, but it also includes a series of practical, alchemical recipes in Latin and English, as well as copious evidence of use (note dirt, every quire is significantly darkened on the opening and closing folios), contemporary corrections, and annotations.|Although this appears to be written by one scribe, unusual features in the format and quire structure suggest something happened in the midst of copying: quire five, with twenty-four leaves begins on f. 65; by the end of the quire the scribe is copying in a compressed manner, trying to squeeze as much text as possible onto the page; he failed, and therefore quire six, with only two leaves, ff. 89-90v, was needed - and notably, the format here is quite expansive, and the text ends mid-line, leaving two lines blank at the end. This seems to suggest that the section of the text beginning in quire seven may have been copied earlier.|Approximately fifty alchemical and medical recipes added to the manuscript by successive users, and/or owners, in Latin and English; note the references to ""a man of Derby named Saul,"" and an ointment of use against paralysis mentioning a doctor at ""Wodestoke"" on f. 111v, and a remedy by Radulf Holonde (Ralph of Holland?) for stones and colic on f. 112v.|Former shelfmark: Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica (Amsterdam, Netherlands), MS 16.|Former shelfmark: Honeyman Collection, MS Gen.sci.3.|Shelfmark: Philadelphia, PA, Donald F. and Mildred Topp Othmer Library of Chemical History, MS 5.|Modern owners' and dealers' notes include, inside front cover, notes on the text in pencil, and small round sticker HH 55 (or 4H 55): and inside back cover, annotations in pencil from BPH (Soth Hun/1101/ FTTT; 84912-BPH 16; and 35P2H).|Belonged to Robert B.
