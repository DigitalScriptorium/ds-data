Ff. 3b and 4a have illuminated head pieces executed in gold leaf and blue and red watercolors. Fol. 363a has a small illuminated tail piece of triangular shape with foliage motifs, executed in gold leaf with blue and red watercolors. The gloss is written around the frame of the main text, most of it clock-wise on the frame-ruled outer edge of the margins, but on some pages the space between the main text frame and the outer egde of the margins is also filled, where the text is written within set geometrical patterns in the shape of crossed triangles, and cypress trees on the top and the bottom of the text frame. The text of the gloss is written in very small naskh with use of red, and to a lesser extent gold, for rubrication. Dark cream glazed paper with visible laid lines. Some additional annotation added on inserted slips, chiefly at the start. Fol. 3a has an elegant small table of contents in gold and black, and several short inscriptions of a later date. It also has a very faint ownership seal. Fol. 1a has an ownership statement in the name of Hacı Ethem, dated 1283 (1866-67).|Originally acquired by Robert Garrett from Abraham Shalom Yahuda ; 1942.","",2024-12-16 09:56:31 -0500,20240307,20241121-princeton-marcxml-hanafi.xml
