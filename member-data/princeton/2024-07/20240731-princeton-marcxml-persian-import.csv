(1772-1856), Broom Hall, Carnarvonshire, Wales. The album was then auctioned in an estate sale between Feb. 24 and March 8, 1857 at Carnarvonshire and was purchased by William Stewart Esq. (1798-1874) of Aldenham Abbey, Hertfordshire. Stewart sold the book at Christie's auction in London in 1875. There was probably another owner after Stewart from whom Robert Garrett (1875-1961) purchased the album.","",2024-10-18 12:10:13 -0400,20240307,20240731-princeton-marcxml-persian.xml
