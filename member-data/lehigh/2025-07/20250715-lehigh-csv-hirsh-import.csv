This one was said to have 240 folios.Ege's and Mewett's each had about 80 folios.|Provenance: It seems possible that they shared one volume of a two-volume set that originated at Valencia--a curious provenance for a grand English liturgical book. Ege retained one decorated folio for his personal collection, now at the Reading Public Museum in Reading, PA . On the manuscript see S.
