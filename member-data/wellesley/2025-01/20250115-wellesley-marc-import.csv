Opening 4-line initial in blue and red with red and dark yellow filigree, with blue and red side bar along outside column. Chapter initials 2-line red and blue with red and blue filigree, extending entire height of column with side bar as on opening page, sub-heading initials 2-line alternating red and blue with blue or red filigree.|Origin: Written at the University of Paris in 1282, not in Italy in 1287 as reported by Jackson and de Ricci. These lectures on Peter Lombard's Sentences were given by Middleton at Paris in 1280-1281; this codex therefore preserves a very early copy of the text. Only the lectures on Book 2 of the Sentences are found in this volume; complete sets of all four volumes of Middleton's commentary are rare. Pecia notations are found throughout the manuscript, written in the outer margin in black ink in a formal Gothic bookhand, sometimes repeated immediately in red. These notes, which were written by the scribe to help him keep track of how many rented sections (""pecia"") of his exemplar he had copied, indicate that the manuscript was produced in a university setting, almost certainly the University of Paris where the pecia system was used during this early period. The final notation beneath the colophon tabulates how much the scribe was owed for his work. There are two sections where the pecia notations are absent: most of quire 1, and quires 15-19. The pecia numbers continue after these lacunae as if there were no numbers missing; in other words, the pecia notes immediately following the lacunae on folios 13 and 223 are the expected numbers given the amount of intervening un-notated leaves. Although this text is listed in a University of Paris stationer's list from 1304 (see Denifle, H. Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis (Paris, 1891), v. 2, p. 109), the exemplar listed there consists of only 61 pecia and therefore is not related to the present copy of the text whose exemplar consisted of 63 pecia. Fourteenth-century marginal notes throughout the manuscript have been wrongly thought throughout the manuscript's history to have been written by Petrarch, a misinterpretation that has led to the publication and dissemination of much that is incorrect regarding the origin and provenance of this manuscript. An older bookplate and various ""evidence"" supporting this theory were added to the manuscript in the nineteenth century and have been preserved with the old parchment endpapers. Effaced fifteenth-century inscription below colophon, with only the words ""ex libris"" and ""cenobii"" legible under ultra-violet light.|Pecia notes are found on the following folios: 5 [prime], 13 [iiii peâ], 17v [v peâ], 22v [pecia viâ], 31 [viii peâ], 35 [ix peâ], 39 [x peâ], 42v [xi peâ], 46v [xii peâ], 51 [xiii peâ], 55 [xiiii peâ], 59 [xv peâ], 63 [xvi], 67v [xvii peâ], 71v [xviii peâ], 75v [xix peâ], 79v [xx peâ], 83v [xxi peâ], 87v [xxii peâ], 91v [xxiii peâ], 95v [xxiiii peâ], 99v [xxv peâ], 103v [xxvi peâ], 107 [xxvii peâ], 111 [xxviii peâ], 115 [xxix peâ], 119 [xxx peâ], 123v [xxxi peâ], 129 [xxxii pecia], 133v [xxxiii peâ], 137v [xxxiiii peâ], 142 [xxxvâ peâ], 145v [xxxviâ peâ], 149v [xxxvii peâ], 153v [xxxviii peâ], 158 [xxxix peâ], 162 [xl peâ], 166v [xli peâ], 170v [xlii peâ], 175 [xliii [peâ], 223 [lv pecia] (this is written in the upper margin, in a different style), 224 [lvâ peâ], 228 [lvi peâ], 232 [lviiâ pecia], 235v [lviiiâ peâ], 240 [lixâ peâ], 244 [lxâ peâ], 248 [lxiâ peâ], 252 [lxiiâ peâ], 255v [lxiiiâ peâ|Bought ca. 1640 at Padua by Marchese Linterno.

This manuscript was produced for Anne de Bretagne and Louis XII. Here the arms of France are quartered with Milan, perhaps indicating that the manuscript was produced during the short period when Louis was both King of France and Duke of Milan (Sept. 6, 1499-February 5, 1500), or, if the manuscript was produced later in his reign, indicating a desire on the part of the King to continue to claim the Dukedom even after it had been wrested away by the Sforza. The arms of France and of Anne de Bretagne, as well as the ornate initials ""L"" and ""A"", are found on the Ricketts fragments. Other leaves of the same manuscript were, in de Ricci's day, part of the C. L.
