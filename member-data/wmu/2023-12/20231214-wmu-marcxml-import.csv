On the dorse is an unusual inscription by a member of the papal chancery explaining that although the document is dated 6th August, it was not expedited until the 28th. Pope Sixtus IV died on the 12th of August, 1484, requiring the chancery to produce a mass of associated documents and thus delaying this bulla's expedition.

Rulings are in ink throughout with prickings in the outer margins. The text is written below the top rule line in two columns, between 26-38 lines per page. The manuscript includes two texts, each copied by a different scribe using different scripts. The first scribe copied 1-26v in a quick upright Gothic noting script; the second scribe copied 26v-40v in a quick, heavily abbreviated Gothic bookhand. Majuscules within text are stroked with red. There are red paragraph marks and fol. 38 has a two line red initial, highlighted in yellowish gold. A later hand (fifteenth century?) has added the notation (possibly a shelf mark) ""S.de.3."" in bold gothic script, black ink, to the bottom margin of fol. 1r. The manuscript has been dated to the late thirteenth century or early fourteenth century on paleographical grounds. Both scribes use the reversed ""c"" to abbreviate ""con,"" and a quick form of the abbreviation for ""est"" which may suggest an origin in Germany, possibly Southern Germany. Regensberg, for example, was a major center of copying the Legenda aureum and the two features mentioned above can be seen in a manuscript copied in Southern Germany (1279 in Thomson, 1969, pl. 40).|The manuscript previously belonged to Joseph Pope (1921-2010) of Toronto, where it was Bergendal Collection MS 104 (described in Pope, 1999, and online, Bergendal Collection; a further account of the collection is given in Pope, 1997).

The motifs and colors used in the red and blue pen initials can be compared with Paris, BnF, MS lat. 16541 (Stirnemann, 1990, no. 39, and p. 70). The style of the painted initials can be compared most closely with the later products of the Johannes Grusch workshop, a rather diverse stylistic group active in the second and third quarters of the thirteenth century (Branner, 1977, appendix VK. pp. 222-223).",,2024-02-01 16:05:28 -0500,2022-12-14,20231214-wmu-marcxml.xml

Currently housed in a wooden frame (406 x 457 mm); charter visible on one side only, with dealer's prospectus on back.|Produced at Bruern Abbey within Oxfordshire, England around 1300. This foundation charter was issued after the actual foundation of the abbey. The Cistercian Abbey of Bruern (Cottineau 1:517) was founded by Nicholas Basset on 10 July 1147, originally as a cell of Garendon Abbey (Cottineau 1:1254) in Leicestershire. By the end of the thirteenth century circumstances at the abbey - presumably financial - required the creation of another charter. The present charter would have been viewed as a posthumous grant by the late founder. The wording of the text reads like a twelfth-century document but the script is late thirteenth or early fourteenth. The monks have accorded themselves more generous land provisions than the founder had actually done. The seal appears authentic and either was unthreaded and reattached from a twelfth-century original or the monks still had the matrix. Even if it was known to be 150 years too recent to be genuine, it would have been acknowledged as the actual foundation charter. Bruern Abbey was suppressed in 1536.

Probably broken by Erich von Scherling (Scherling, 102; History of Western Script, 55). Von Sherling's source seems to have been a bound fragment of leaves from Leviticus 3 to Judges 2. It must have been volume 1 of a 4 volume Bible, of which, 2-3 appear to be Brussels, Bibliothèque royale, MS II.2523, and volume 4 may be Los Angles, J. Paul Getty Museum MS Ludwig 1.9. The Brussels volumes had belonged to Sir Thomas Phillipps, who bought them in the late 1820s with the residue of the library of St Martin in Tournai, noting ruefully that the first volume had been sold in his absence and ""destroyed by a bookseller at Brussels"" (Phillipps, Catalogus Librorum Manuscriptorum, 1837, entry for MS 2011; A. N. L. Munby, Phillips Studies, III, 1954, 22, n. 1; C. de Hamel in Migrations, Medieval Manuscripts in New Zealand, ed. Hollis and Barratt, 2007, 42-3). The first item in the catalogue of St Martin's abbey in Tournai in 1615 was ""Biblia 4. Voluminibus"" (Sanderus, Bibliotheca Belgica Manuscripta, 1, 1641, p. 91). The leaf was eventually sold by Swann Galleries (New York, 22 March 1990) as part of lot 75 to the celebrated manuscript collector, Martin Schøyen, in whose collection it was catalogued as Schøyen MS 82 (History of Western Scripts, 102).",,2024-02-01 16:05:28 -0500,2022-01-07,20231214-wmu-marcxml.xml

Text taken from John 20:11. The text opens with Mass for the Tuesday within the Octave of Easter, celebrated on April 10. While the use of multi-colored initials was banned by Cistercian statutes, the ban was widely ignored, and the punctus flexus punctuation found here is typical of books written for the Order.|Excised from a larger manuscript. 4-line initial in red and in the margin with bowed and rounded strokes; 1-line initials and rubrics in red; capitals touched in red; irregular text size; Cistercian puntus flexus and puntus elevatus punctuation throughout; cues in the inner margin of verso. 1 column of 24 lines lead point or very light ink ruling written in formal angular Protogothic minuscule in brown ink. Script conforms to the earlier Carolingian minuscule, except that the shapes have become slightly compressed and angular and developed little hooked feet. However the letters are well separated and have not evolved into the rows of minims of fully developed Gothic script. Text written above the top line. Prickings in inner margins. The number ""40"" written in pencil on top corner of recto.|Owned by Otto Ege who broke up the book. Since the style was imitated in monasteries throughout Europe, it can be very difficult to localise; Ege himself took this manuscript to be Spanish, but the Missal is now thought to be either south German or, more probably, Austrian. The parent manuscript included on f.105v an added Mass for St Robert of Molesmes, co-founder of Cîteaux, canonised in 1222. The parent manuscript (with 173 leaves and 13 large initials) was no 17 in the c.1928 auction catalogue of EMIL HIRSCH (1866-1954), which likely orginate from the Hohenfurth / Vyšší Brod monastery. Peter Kidd points out that Hirsch also owned two other manuscripts now at the British Library, both from Cistercian houses in southern Germany or Austria, one of which may have been written in 1191 for the Abbey of Wilhering, west of Linz.",,2024-02-01 16:05:28 -0500,2022-09-12,20231214-wmu-marcxml.xml

The script and the decoration suggest a French production. According to Avril, 'Un manuscrit d'auteurs classiques' (1975), pp. 268-69, the decoration might be connected with the second artist of a manuscript containing classical works (Paris, BnF, MS lat. 7936) produced in Paris. Although there are common features between the initials of both manuscripts, 'their historiated initials cannot be ascribed to the same hand' according to Frońska, Royal Manuscripts (2011). A Parisian Bible produced around 1200, now Berlin, Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, MS theol. lat. fol. 9, is close to this manuscript in script and decoration (see Ayres, 'Parisian Bibles' (1982), 5-13).",,2024-02-01 16:05:28 -0500,2022-09-12,20231214-wmu-marcxml.xml

Based on the prominence of Dominican saints in the calendar, Konrad Tronner copied this Breviary for Dominican use, perhaps his own or the use of a Dominican nun in a sister house. The inclusion of certain Dominican patron saints as well as evidence of decoration indicate that the book originated in the Alsace region. The final quire of the book was a fifteenth-century addition to the volume based on evidence of script and was later bound in the sixteenth century based on the flyleaf watermark. The IHS monogram stamp on the upper board is similar to two localized to sixteenth-century Bavaria.

The marginal ink drawings, all carefully colored, include decorated pointed hands (maniculae) with elaborate sleeves, angels, lions, and a man in a boat. The texts gathered include sermons and monastic rules and the commentaries, which speak to the concerns of the original owner. The miscenllany of texts include selections of sermons from the Regula by Augustine; the Homilia VI-IX by Caesarius of Arles; the Homilia III by Eucherius of Lyon; the Sermo castigationis by Eusebius Gallicanus; the Sermo 23 by Caesrarius of Arles, which could also be attributed to Faustus of Riez; the Regula Sancti Augustini by St. Augustine of Hippo; the Expositio in Regulam Beati Augustini by Hugh of St. Victor; the Bullarum Romanum 4 by Pope Benedict XII; the Corpus iuris canonici by Pope Urban V; and the Homilia II, Homilia VIII, and Homilia X by Eusebius Gallicanus.|Binding: Eighteenth-century binding of smooth taw leather over cardboard with three sewing supports, green and white endbands, label in brown ink at head of spine reading ""Semon \\| es Sancti \\| Ca'sarij,"" imports and holes remaining on front and back cover from two ties, traces of which are visible through paper pastedowns, paper bookplot in inner pastedown of the Bibliotheque du Plessis-Villoutreys including escutcheon with crown above and motto ""Dis peu Fais mieux"" below, some concave warping of boards and discoloration or staining of cover and pastedowns, but binding is intact and in sturdy condition.|Collation: [original first gathering missing] i8 [-1 through 5, first five leaves missing with text loss], ii8, iii8 [-8, final folio cancelled with no text loss], iv-xxii8, xxiii7 [structure uncertain, no text loss], xxiv, xxv-xxvii8.|Decoration: Majuscules, letter ascenders and descenders are flourished and washed in yellow throughout. Paraphs marks in blue. Rubics in red. Numberous 2-to-8-line initials in alternating red and blue with contrasting pen flourishes. 6-line parted red and blue initial with pen decoration (f. 92v). One initial in brown holds the face of a young monk (f. 28r). Catchwords, most in banderoles, in tiny miniatures.|Marginalia: Many small marginal drawings which include maniculae extending from sleeves of red, blue, and yellow, often reaching from twinkling clouds and holding flowers, vines, or banderoles containing notae or catchwords. Other miniatures, some also holding notae and catchwords, are of rosy-cheeked angels with yellow hair and their garments, halos, and wings highlighted in red, blue, orange, and yellow. Further marginal drawings, some also bearing banderoles, include crosses and columns, a man in a miniature boat (f. 55), lions (ff. 98v and 162v), a bird (f. 154v), a tiny empty tunic (f. 119v), and a monk (f. 138v).|Script: Text written in 17-21 long lines on ff. 1-184 and 16-19 long lines on ff. 184v-213v by several contemporary scribes in a compact script, except ff. 184v-213v in a larger and freer hand, all in a skilled French cursive tending towards lettre batarde featuring documentary-style flourishing in bottom, outer, and occasionallly upper margins. Frame ruling in faint graphite with bounding lines extending to edges (justification c. 85-95 x 65 mm). Most incipits in an upright and rigid Gothic textualis. Larger text size starting on f. 184v, possibly a change of hands.|Written in several hands at the end of the 14th century or beginning of the 15th century in southern France, possibly Avignon, as suggested by the style of the initials, and to a lesser extend the script, which features some elements borrowed from the Papal Chancery, then in Avignon. Datable between 1369 (it includes a papal bull by Urban V (r. 1362-70) issued on 4 April 1369) and ca. 1400. Given the inclusion of the rule of St. Augustine and Hugh of St. Victor's commentary on the Rule, the codex was likely made for one of the many groups of canons or monks who followed this Rule, including Augustinian Hermits (Agustin Friars), Dominicans, Praemonstratensians, Trinitarians, Regular Canons, and others. Evidence of the first sixteen sermons (ff. 1-80) by Clements VII link the manuscript to the Celestine priory established in 1392. A bookplate of the Bibliothèque du Plessis-Villoutreys indicates ownership by the Marquis de Villoutreys, probably in the last quarter of the 19th century. Possibly part of a private European Collection at some point. Purchased by Western Michigan University Special Collections from Les Enluminures (TM 992).",,2024-02-01 16:05:28 -0500,2022-12-15,20231214-wmu-marcxml.xml
