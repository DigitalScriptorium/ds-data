This foundation charter was issued after the actual foundation of the abbey. The Cistercian Abbey of Bruern (Cottineau 1:517) was founded by Nicholas Basset on 10 July 1147, originally as a cell of Garendon Abbey (Cottineau 1:1254) in Leicestershire. By the end of the thirteenth century circumstances at the abbey - presumably financial - required the creation of another charter. The present charter would have been viewed as a posthumous grant by the late founder. The wording of the text reads like a twelfth-century document but the script is late thirteenth or early fourteenth. The monks have accorded themselves more generous land provisions than the founder had actually done. The seal appears authentic and either was unthreaded and reattached from a twelfth-century original or the monks still had the matrix. Even if it was known to be 150 years too recent to be genuine, it would have been acknowledged as the actual foundation charter. Bruern Abbey was suppressed in 1536.

The manuscript has been dated to the late thirteenth century or early fourteenth century on paleographical grounds. Both scribes use the reversed ""c"" to abbreviate ""con,"" and a quick form of the abbreviation for ""est"" which may suggest an origin in Germany, possibly Southern Germany. Regensberg, for example, was a major center of copying the Legenda aureum and the two features mentioned above can be seen in a manuscript copied in Southern Germany (1279 in Thomson, 1969, pl. 40).|The manuscript previously belonged to Joseph Pope (1921-2010) of Toronto, where it was Bergendal Collection MS 104 (described in Pope, 1999, and online, Bergendal Collection; a further account of the collection is given in Pope, 1997).

The marginal ink drawings, all carefully colored, include decorated pointed hands (maniculae) with elaborate sleeves, angels, lions, and a man in a boat. The texts gathered include sermons and monastic rules and the commentaries, which speak to the concerns of the original owner. The miscenllany of texts include selections of sermons from the Regula by Augustine; the Homilia VI-IX by Caesarius of Arles; the Homilia III by Eucherius of Lyon; the Sermo castigationis by Eusebius Gallicanus; the Sermo 23 by Caesrarius of Arles, which could also be attributed to Faustus of Riez; the Regula Sancti Augustini by St. Augustine of Hippo; the Expositio in Regulam Beati Augustini by Hugh of St. Victor; the Bullarum Romanum 4 by Pope Benedict XII; the Corpus iuris canonici by Pope Urban V; and the Homilia II, Homilia VIII, and Homilia X by Eusebius Gallicanus.|Binding: Eighteenth-century binding of smooth taw leather over cardboard with three sewing supports, green and white endbands, label in brown ink at head of spine reading ""Semon \\| es Sancti \\| Ca'sarij,"" imports and holes remaining on front and back cover from two ties, traces of which are visible through paper pastedowns, paper bookplot in inner pastedown of the Bibliotheque du Plessis-Villoutreys including escutcheon with crown above and motto ""Dis peu Fais mieux"" below, some concave warping of boards and discoloration or staining of cover and pastedowns, but binding is intact and in sturdy condition.|Collation: [original first gathering missing] i8 [-1 through 5, first five leaves missing with text loss], ii8, iii8 [-8, final folio cancelled with no text loss], iv-xxii8, xxiii7 [structure uncertain, no text loss], xxiv, xxv-xxvii8.|Decoration: Majuscules, letter ascenders and descenders are flourished and washed in yellow throughout.

One initial in brown holds the face of a young monk (f. 28r). Catchwords, most in banderoles, in tiny miniatures.|Marginalia: Many small marginal drawings which include maniculae extending from sleeves of red, blue, and yellow, often reaching from twinkling clouds and holding flowers, vines, or banderoles containing notae or catchwords. Other miniatures, some also holding notae and catchwords, are of rosy-cheeked angels with yellow hair and their garments, halos, and wings highlighted in red, blue, orange, and yellow. Further marginal drawings, some also bearing banderoles, include crosses and columns, a man in a miniature boat (f. 55), lions (ff. 98v and 162v), a bird (f. 154v), a tiny empty tunic (f. 119v), and a monk (f. 138v).|Script: Text written in 17-21 long lines on ff. 1-184 and 16-19 long lines on ff. 184v-213v by several contemporary scribes in a compact script, except ff. 184v-213v in a larger and freer hand, all in a skilled French cursive tending towards lettre batarde featuring documentary-style flourishing in bottom, outer, and occasionallly upper margins.

Datable between 1369 (it includes a papal bull by Urban V (r. 1362-70) issued on 4 April 1369) and ca. 1400. Given the inclusion of the rule of St. Augustine and Hugh of St. Victor's commentary on the Rule, the codex was likely made for one of the many groups of canons or monks who followed this Rule, including Augustinian Hermits (Agustin Friars), Dominicans, Praemonstratensians, Trinitarians, Regular Canons, and others. Evidence of the first sixteen sermons (ff. 1-80) by Clements VII link the manuscript to the Celestine priory established in 1392. A bookplate of the Bibliothèque du Plessis-Villoutreys indicates ownership by the Marquis de Villoutreys, probably in the last quarter of the 19th century. Possibly part of a private European Collection at some point.

Based on the prominence of Dominican saints in the calendar, Konrad Tronner copied this Breviary for Dominican use, perhaps his own or the use of a Dominican nun in a sister house. The inclusion of certain Dominican patron saints as well as evidence of decoration indicate that the book originated in the Alsace region. The final quire of the book was a fifteenth-century addition to the volume based on evidence of script and was later bound in the sixteenth century based on the flyleaf watermark. The IHS monogram stamp on the upper board is similar to two localized to sixteenth-century Bavaria.
