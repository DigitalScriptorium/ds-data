W. Dutschke,|The poem on ff. ii verso-iv (art. 1) appears to have been written to honor the de Vere family, earls of Oxford; its inclusion in this manuscript may suggest an early association with John de Vere (1408-61/62), 12th Earl of Oxford, who after his father's death in 1417 became ward of the Duke of Exeter and in 1426 of the Duke of Bedford; both men were kinsmen of Chaucer's son, Thomas. One of the executors of the will of John de Vere (1442-1512/13), 13th Earl of Oxford, was Sir Robert Drury of Hawsted in Suffolk, 17 miles northeast of Castle Hedingham, the family seat of the de Veres. On f. i verso, s. XVI2/4, ""Robertus drury miles [space], William drury miles, Robertus drury miles, domina Jarmin, domina Jarningam, dommina Alington,"" referring to Sir Robert Drury (mentioned above as executor; speaker of the House of Commons in 1495 and a member of Henry VIII's Council), to his sons William and Robert, and to his 3 daughters: Anna, married first to George Waldegrave, and after his death in 1528 to Sir Thomas Jermyn; Bridget, married to Sir John Jernyngham (Jernegan, of Somerleyton); Ursula (d. 1521), married to Sir Giles Alington. Among the legatees of the 13th Earl of Oxford's will were the elder Robert Drury's sons-in-law, George Waldegrave and Sir Giles Alington. On f. ii, the names ""Domina Jernegan"" and ""Domina Jernegan, Domina Alington"" are repeated; on f. i verso, ""Edwarde Waldegrave"" (uncle, d. 1500, or son, b. 1514, of George Waldegrave). On ff. i verso and iv verso, s. XV or XVIin, several times, the name and once the phrase, ""Margery seynt John ys a shrew"" (George Waldegrave had a niece, d. 1536, and a great-niece, d. 1562, by that name). On f. i verso, s. XVI, ""Thomas Calthorpp of"" (a Thomas Calthorpe, d. 1559, was great-nephew of the elder Sir Robert Drury's first wife, Anna, daughter of Sir William Calthorpe of Norwich). On f. ii, the initials ""HD"" and on f. 147v, ""Henricus Drury Miles"" (possibly the son of William Drury). On f. 130, s. XVI, ""...per me henricum Payne"" followed by a paraph, possibly referring to the Henry Payne of Nowton, near Hawsted, a member of Lincoln's Inn, d. 1568; his will shows that he had purchased lands from the Drurys; he had witnessed Sir William Drury's will in 1557 and had had a legacy from him; in his own will, he bequeathed to Sir Giles Alington, grandson of Ursula Drury and her husband Giles Alington, ""the beste geldyng he will choise of eny that I haue And also my Chaucer written in vellum and illumyned with golde."" On f. ii, s. XVI, ""per me Thomam Badbeye,"" brother-in-law of Sir Ambrose Jermyn (son of the Sir Thomas Jermyn who had married Anna Drury). On ff. 64 and v recto and verso (= first back flyleaf), the name of John Hedgeman; on f. 175, the name occurs in a longer inscription, much faded, but which may read ""John Hedgeman of Hawkedoun in the Countie of Suff. ? neyther squier nor knight But a knave""; Hawkedon is near the Drury seat at Hawsted and some 20 miles east of Castle Hedingham. The remaining sixteenth century ownership marks are without known connection to the de Vere or Drury families. On ff. ii verso, iii and vii verso (= third back flyleaf; erased), s. XV1, a motto, ""de meuz en meuz"" (de mieux en mieux?), perhaps that of the Paston family, although it seems unlikely that the book could have belonged to them at that date. On ff. ii, 229v, both times upside down, ""Rycher Challes."" On ff. 48, 108, ""...Eilliam Sayer."" On f. 48, ""John Neue de oxenborowe in comt. norff. salutem percipe quod et cetera,"" ""Rog?se Smith [?],"" and a note about Thomas, Duke of Norfolk (d. 1572). On f. 54, ""Thome R?dell?nold Gregorye Nycholas Arnold."" On f. 169v, ""Willem?te detho [?]."" On f. vi (= second back flyleaf), ""Thomas Newman yeve these with my hartie comendacions ?."" On f. vi verso (= second back flyleaf), ""...Edmond Bedingfelde esquier ? at Wightoun ?."" The sixteenth century notes in the same hand beside the figure of the Miller (f. 34v), ""Robin with the Bagpype,"" and the figure of the Nun's Priest (f. 179), ""Robert Nytipole"" (nitty = full of nits; pole, variant spelling of poll = head) may be intended as teasing gibes at an owner or owner's friend (but see Manly and Rickert, 1:155). On ff. iv verso and v (= first back flyleaf) are verses (arts. 2, 3, 29, 30) signed R.N. or R. North; on ff. ii and iv verso, the note, ""1 Durum 5 Pati 68 R. North,"" giving the date 1568 and the motto ""Durum pati"" of Roger North (1530/31-1600), 2nd Lord North. For further speculation on the identities of these individuals, see Manly and Rickert, 1:152-59. On f. ii, the pressmark ""Q.3"" in the hand of John Egerton (1579-1649), 1st Earl of Bridgewater, corrected by John Egerton (1622-86), 2nd Earl of Bridgewater to ""Q.3/3."" The manuscript was housed at that time at Ashridge, in Hertfordshire, formerly the college of the ""Boni Homines"" whose lands and buildings had been acquired in 1604 by the first Earl's father, Sir Thomas Egerton, Baron Ellesmere and Viscount Brackley. The Ashridge location was mistakenly understood as Ashridge origin by Todd, Illustrations , and mentioned by A. Egerton in her introduction to the facsimile. The Bridgewater library descended through the Egerton family to George Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Marquis of Stafford (afterward 1st Duke of Sutherland); from 1803 to 1833 the present manuscript was known as the ""Stafford Chaucer."" His younger son, Francis Egerton, created Earl of Ellesmere in 1846, inherited the library.","",2024-07-09 16:50:00 -0400,20210621,20240103-huntington-marcxml.xml

(f. 62v); ""Felbrygg"" scratched into the outer margin of f. 13v. The de la Pole and Cheyne obits in the calendar might be explained if the manuscript passed to Margaret's daughter Elizabeth, and after the latter's death to her husband Miles Stapleton's second wife, Katherine, daughter of Thomas de la Pole and Anne, née Cheyne. Owned, s. XV, by someone with a special veneration for Peter of Verona (feast added to calendar, and prayer added on f. 61v). Inscribed ""tout ma fiance"", perhaps a motto, written twice (f. 62v).

[i.e. 1556/7], appears to be initialed by the scribe ""P W"" and signed ""William Pa[x?]er of the towne of Congleton within the [county of Cheshire]"" (f. 63r). This may perhaps relate to the fact that Simon Felbrigg had three daughters (Alana, Anne, and Elizabeth) by his marriage to Margaret, and no further offspring by his second marriage; Anne was the owner of the Felbrigge Psalter in the British Library (Sloane MS 2400), whose calendar includes the added obits of her parents Simon and Margaret.

Dutschke, 7/7/2009.|Written in England, perhaps before 1416 as the feast of John of Beverley (d. 721; feast ordered for England in that year) is an addition to the calendar. The prominence of Chad in the original calendar, other principal feasts, and the later additions suggests origin and use in the diocese of Lichfield. The addition in the 15th century of both the dedication of the church at Desford (about 25 miles east of Lichfield and 7 miles west of Leicester), and the feast of St Hardulf (to whom a church at Breedon on the Hill, about 15 miles north-north-west of Desford, is dedicated, but who is otherwise unknown), strongly suggests use in the parish of Desford. The additions of feasts of St Modwenna of Burton upon Trent (about 12 miles west of Breedon on the Hill), including the very rare feast of her translation, confirm the connection to this area. ""Obitus Anne Shirley"" is added to the calendar (1 Dec.), she was presumably a close relative of Sir Ralph Shirley (d. 1466) who lived at Staunton Harold, about 3 miles south-west of Breedon on the Hill (in which church several family members are buried). Ff. iv-v are two leaves of notes signed by J[oseph] Stevenson (1806-1895), historian, archivist, and Church of England clergyman (on whom see the ODNB), dated at Cambridge, 1836.

The quires in all 3 manuscripts are signed in roman numerals in the lower right corner of the last leaf verso: in Add. 10052, i-ix; in HM 112, x-xvii (but with the penultimate full quire, i.e. now quire 8, skipped; the last 3 leaves, all singletons, have no roman numeral); in Add. 10053, xviii (on the first leaf, a singleton, presumably the end of the last quire in HM 112), then xix-xxix followed by 4 more quires (the first 2 labelled a and b); it would thus appear that the roman numerals represent an effort to unite separate materials. Add. 10053, ff. 1-83 and, possibly with some variations, ff. 85-98, are by the same hand as the second part of HM 112. The name of John Pery is associated with both: in HM 112, on f. 78v, the explicit reads "". . . quod I. Pery"" (perhaps in a different hand from the rest of the explicit); in Add. 10053, on f. 29 ""quod I. Pery"" and on f. 83 ""Orate pro anima domini Iohannis Pery canonici ecclesie sancte trinitatis london. infra algate qui hunc librum fieri fecit cuius anime propicietur deus Amen.""|Inputter: C. W. Dutschke, 9/4/2009.|The 3 manuscripts, Add. 10052, HM 112 and Add. 10053 were still a single volume when seen and noted by Bernard, vol. 2, n. 6593 in the collection of Charles Theyer (b. 1651), who had inherited from his grandfather, the antiquary John Theyer (1597-1673) a collection of manuscripts originating in the library of Llanthony priory bequeathed to John Theyer by his uncle Richard Hart, last prior of that house (catalogue, s. XIV, in London, Brit. Lib., Harley 460). After Charles Theyer's unsuccessful efforts to offer the books to Oxford University, they passed to the London bookseller Robert Scott. A catalogue compiled in 1678 (London, Brit. Lib., Royal Appendix 70) does not list Add. 10052-HM 112-Add. 10053; this collection was purchased by Charles II and passed with the Royal Library to the British Museum. The manuscript which is now Add. 10052, HM 112 and Add. 10053 may have been split up and bound separately by 1807, date of Richard Heber's purchase of Add. 10053 (since he purchased Add. 10052 only in 1819). HM 112 may have received its present binding while in the possession of George Offor (1787-1864), since the date of 1824 is on the paper flyleaves that contain an account of the text signed by Offor. It survived the fire at Sotheby's, 28 June 1865, although it is not one of the manuscripts listed for the first day's sale: 27 June 1865, lot 2666; the only signs of damage to HM 112 are dark stains on the edges of the front and back flyleaves, corresponding to the shape of the turn-ins. Belonged to Sir Thomas Brooke (1830-1908); see A Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Printed Books Collected by Thomas Brooke F.S.A. (London 1891) 1:253. A number of other manuscripts which belonged to him were bequeathed by his brother, Canon C. E. Brooke to Keble College in 1911; see M. B.

W.

The manuscript was almost certainly in an institutional library in the fifteenth century, since below the rubric on f. 3, a later hand has added ""2o folio; causa distinctionis."" Marginal notes by early owners: f. 2, 15th c.: ""Thoma Northall solvit domino Iohanni Wynton v s. viii d.,"" and on f. 334, 16th c.: ""prec. xvi s."" followed by an erasure. Belonged to the Welsh antiquary Robert Davies of Llannerch and Gwysaney (ca. 1658-1710). The earliest known catalogue of the Llannerch manuscripts, dated 1740, lists this manuscript as n. 14 (that number in ink on the front pastedown); the manuscript also appears in the 1778 catalogue as n. 69 (the cover of the manuscript has been rebacked, and thus probably lost its label with this designation). Later, when the collection had passed through inheritance to Philip Bryan Davies Cooke, a list of its contents was printed by the HMC, 6th Report , pt. I (1887-88); this manuscript on p. 419. When owned by Lt.-Col. Philip Ralph Davies-Cooke (b. 1896), the collection was placed on deposit in the National Library of Wales, 1947-59, where this book bore the number ""Gwysaney 19"" (in pencil on the inner front cover).

Because of the varying lengths of the prayers, the illustrations occur irregularly on versos and rectos. The woodcuts are similar to a series of 27 Passion woodcuts in London, British Museum, Dept. of Prints and Drawings, 1856-10-11-1 through 28, which are printed on parchment, accompanied by prayers in German, and dated 1457. For a description of this series, see C. Dodgson, Catalogue of Early German and Flemish Woodcuts preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum (London 1903), A 7; for reproductions, see C. Dodgson, Woodcuts of the XV Century in the Department of Prints and Drawings, British Museum (London 1934), nn. 48-75, pl. 10-14. Both the Huntington and the British Museum series bear relationships to the work of Albrecht Pfister, as suggested by H. C. Schulz, ""Albrecht Pfister and the Nürnberg Woodcut School,"" Gutenberg Jahrbuch (1953) 39-49. The woodcuts of HM 195 are reproduced in G. Gugenbauer, Inkunabeln der Graphik in den Klosterbibliotheken Ober-Österreichs und Salzburgs. Einblattdrucke des Funfzehnten Jahrhunderts, ed. P. Heitz, v. 35 (Strasbourg 1913) 29-32 and nn. 9-26; full descriptions of the woodcuts are given in W. L.

Belonged to the Benedictine abbey of Nonnbergin the diocese of Salzburg, where it apparently bore the pressmark 26.A*.11 (not in the book). Prayers occasionally use feminine forms. Inscriptions include: on the front pastedown, ""1623L"" and an erasure; on f. iii verso, ""Auss der Nunbergerisch Librerei"" (now partially erased); on f. 1, the date 1584, the motto ""Mein vertrauen steet in Cristo all __cropped___,"" and erased name and the title, s.

Dutschke, 2/11/2012.|A 13th century note on f. 2v, ""Hic eusebius fuit de cremona ut narat Cirillus in epistola ad augustinum"" suggests, through its orthography and interest in Cremona, early ownership, if not origin in northern Italy. Wrongly said to have belonged to Petrarch and to have been among the books from his house near Milan, and to have been left by him to the Carthusians of Garegnano. In certain copies of Giacomo Filippo Tomasini, Petrarcha redivivus (2nd ed., Padua 1650) 281-86, a list of 114 codices, which, ostensibly having belonged to Petrarch, are said to have been bought in Padua by a ""Marchese Linterno""; HM 1083 is n. 3 in that list (for the thorough study of the provenance of the Linterno codices, see G. Billanovich, ""Nuovi autografi (autentici) e vecchi autografi (falsi) del Petrarca,"" IMU 22 (1979), 223-38, especially pp. 236-38 for the present location of 14 of the codices, and pp. 237-38 for HM 1083). Of these presumed 114 codices, 26 later belonged to the Visconti di Modrone; ceded in 1834 by Duke Carlo Visconti di Modrone (d. 1836) to the Milanese engineer Giuseppe Bruschetti (1793-1871), who sold them to the bookdealer Gaetano Schiepatti; his sale catalogue of the Linterno codices issued in 1865. Offered to, but refused by the Italian government, because of their false attribution of ownership to Petrarch. Bought by another Milanese bookdealer, Luigi Arrigoni; HM 1083 is n. 2 in his sale catalogue (1883). At Arrigoni's death (1886), the remaining Linterno codices acquired by J. Rosenthal; placed by him at auction. Sotheby's, 12 April 1899; HM 1083 as lot 538 to Quaritch. Belonged to John Boyd Thacher of New York; his sale, Anderson, New York, 8 January 1914, pt.

Below the explicit on f. 150v, in a more formal script, possibly by a different person, but difficult to see clearly due to discoloration from a reagent, another note with the same date of 1591 and the name of the copyist (?), ""By me Edward Gregorie scholler at Bunburye the yeare of our lord god 1591.""

XVII, ""John Egerton esq.,"" probably not one of the first three Earls of Bridgewater, all of whom bore that name, but rather another member of the Egerton family, who possessed properties in Cheshire. J. Payne Collier in the 1831 edition of his History of English Dramatic Poetry, 2:227 states that the manuscript had been ""only very recently"" discovered and that it had come into the possession of J. B. Nichols, esq., F.S.A. (presumably John Bowyer Nichols, 1779-1863, of The Gentleman's Magazine) from an unnamed gentleman of Cheshire; Nichols' name is omitted in the 1879 edition. It was first suggested by W. W. Greg, ""Bibliographical and Textual Problems of the English Miracle Cycles,"" The Library 5 (1914) 170 that the modern transcription from Harley 2013 on ff. I-XII (paper watermarked 1829) was supplied by J. Payne Collier, presumably meaning that Collier obtained the transcription or had it done, rather than copying it himself, as the script does not resemble other examples of Collier's handwriting in the Huntington Library. By 1836, when Collier printed the Antichrist pageant (art. 23) in his Five Miracle Plays, the manuscript had passed into the collection of the Duke of Devonshire; it was temporarily mislaid and not available to H. Deimling for his 1892 edition.

The manuscript is dated 1557, possibly Old Style; in that case, it may not be the book listed among the ""New Year's Gifts presented to Queen Mary in 1556"" [which is certainly Old Style, as the subtitle refers to 3 and 4 Philip and Mary] in Illustrations of the Manners and Expences of Antient Times in England . . .

W. Dutschke, 7/30/2012.|Written in 1461-1462, according to the marginal notes and the colophon, f. 359v, by Haquinet le Pesquier. His monogram appears below his name on f. 359v and in the pen flourishes on ff. 247v and 248. The first owner of the manuscript was Jean de Croy, sieur de Chimay (d. 1473), whose coat of arms is in the initials at the beginning of each book; his motto, Souveingne vous, and device, an armoured merman, usually alternate in the chapter initials. On ff. 110v, and 196v, in the pen flourishes at the bottom of the text, the same coat of arms with the quarters reversed, encircled by the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece. ""Messire Iean de Croy, seigneur de Tour-sur-Marne"" was nominated to the Order by Philip the Good; see H. Kervyn de Lettenhove, La Toison d'or (Brussels 1907) 91. Erased inscription f. 359v, ""C'est le livre de Jehan boccace en__?___1 est a mo__?___oy comte __?___,"" which may be that of Charles de Croy, comte de Chimay until 1486, thereafter prince de Chimay, known to have signed his books in this fashion; see A. Bayot, Martin Le Franc: L'Estrif De Fortune et De Vertu (Paris 1928) 52-56, for a partial list of the manuscripts which belonged to the Croy de Chimay family; for the manuscripts in the 1614 sale of Charles de Croy (1560-1612), see E. van Even, ""Notice sur la bibliothèque de Charles de Croy, duc d'Aerschot,"" Bulletin du Bibliophile Belge 9 (1852) 380-93 and 436-51; HM 937 does not appear in either list. Belonged to Marc-Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy Comte d'Argenson (1696-1764) whose arms are on the covers; see H. Martin, Catalogue des Manuscrits de la Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, (Paris 1899) t. VIII ""Histoire de la Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal"" p. 116, where this manuscript appears on the inventory of the Comte d'Argenson. It was inherited by his son, Marc-René, Marquis de Voyer (1722-82), and sold by him to his cousin, Antoine-René de Voyer d'Argenson, marquis de Paulmy (1722-87) who listed it in his hand-written inventory, Paris, Arsenal, MS 6291, p. 99, before selling it to the book dealer Molini, evidently because he already had other finely illuminated copies of this text (""double moins beau que les autres,"" possibly in reference to Paris, Arsenal, MS 5193, with 150 miniatures). Belonged to Frederick William Brooke Thellusson, Baron of Rendlesham (1840-1911); his sale, Sotheby's, 27 February 1899, lot 1829 to Leighton. Owned by Charles Butler (1821-1910); his sale, Sotheby's, 5 April 1911, lot 183 to Edwards. Acquired by Herschel V. Jones of Minneapolis (1861-1928); his sale, Anderson, New York, 29 January 1919 pt.

Belonged to Pier Leoni (d. 1492), physician to Lorenzo de' Medici. The inventory of Leoni's books is published in L. Dorez, ""Recherches sur la bibliothèque de Pier Leoni, médecin de Laurent de Médicis,"" Revue des Bibliothèques 7 (1987) 81-106, where this manuscript may be identified with item 8, ""Aristoteles de natura animalium."" The single title, corresponding to HM 1035 as it stands today, suggests that the book had been bound in its more complete state (cf. the multiple titles on the spine, which must have referred to the text[s] on the missing 130 folios at the beginning of the book) and had then been dismembered before 1582, when the inventory of Leoni's library was compiled.

This manuscript was apparently copied from the edition of Ovid printed by Hermann Liechtenstein in Vicenza, 1480 (Hain-Copinger 12141). Overall order is similar, in blocks: the printed text gives Heroides, the Sappho material, the Sabinus material, Amores, (here ff. 61-186v); Ars amatoria, De remedio amoris (here ff. 1-59v); Ibis, Fasti, De tristibus, Ex Ponto (not in this manuscript); Pulex, Philomena, Medicamina faciei, Nux, Ad Liviam (here ff. 187-203). De remedio amoris is divided into two books, both in the manuscript and in the 1480 edition. The 2 match in the presence or absence of supplemental material: two introductory couplets in the Heroides, the sections on Sappho and Sabinus, three responsory letters. They correspond in variant readings, in spellings (except for greater frequency of the diphthong ae in the printed text), and capitalization. The occasional incorrect initial in the manuscript (ff. 89, 168, 170, 180v) may be due to the fact that the initials were not printed in the 1480 edition, but left blank to be filled in by hand. This correspondence was first observed by M. D. Reeve. On ff. 1 and 141 of HM 1038, the arms of the original owner: quarterly 1 and 4, or three bars sable, 2 and 3 gules two bars and 9 martlets argent 3, 3, and 3. On f. 203 the erased inscription, s. XVI: Dono accepit Augustinus Amodeus a Domino Dominico Seglia. Later owned by Ambroise Firmin Didot (1790-1876); his sale, Paris, 9 June 1881, n. 7 to Techener; Baron François Florentin Achille Seillière (1813-73); his sales, Paris, 1890, n. 1221, and 1893, n. 146.

Works are mainly in prose in the form of full sermons, which are sometimes reduced to sententiae; the preaching material towards the end is arranged schematically into distinctions. Among the authors cited are Stephen Langton as archbishop (e.g. f. 57), John of Cornwall (e.g. f. 23v) and Bernard (e.g. f. 92). There are a few sections in verse, and considerable later marginalia with didactic verses or proverbs, the majority of which are unattributed, although some are ascribed to Bernard or to the Church Fathers. The collection, made up of numerous parts, was apparently put together over a period of time by one or more writers; the divisions between the texts are not always clearly distinguishable.|Span folios: ff. 1-147v.

Written by several hands in a small spiky littera textualis.|The texts have contemporary cross-referencing, consisting of quire numbers, leaves within the quire, sometimes the page, the position on the page, a mention of the rubric and a tie mark, for example: f. 91v, ""Ad idem in anteriori parte ultimi folii iiiiti quaterni versus finem. Et in anteriori parte secundi folii v quaterni circa medium de herbis"" (with no corresponding marks on ff. 24, 26 to which this note refers); f. 104, ""Ad idem in dextera parte penultimo folio xvi quaterni"" (with a tie mark) and its reverse reference on f. 131v, ""Ad idem in sinistra parte vii [sic] folio xiiii quaterni"" (with the matching tie mark). Other marginalia consist of finding notes, often touched with color, and nota marks; running headlines have been added on ff. 110-123.|Decoration: Rubrics, when present, are usually in red; on ff. 110-123, they are in the ink of the text touched in green, as are the authorities carefully listed in the margins. Initials are seldom more than 2 lines in height, and usually plain red; occasionally they may be in green, yellow or a bright turquoise blue. The first letters of the distinctions on ff. 124-135 are touched in red, green, yellow or bright blue with only one color used on a given opening; on ff. 140-147 the initials have simple flourishes of another color. Sketches of animals in the lower margins of ff. 10, 14v, 30v and 59; on f. 36 a large sketch colored in green showing a monk and an angel conversing.

Heimann, ""A Twelfth-Century Manuscript from Winchcombe and its illustrations: Dublin, Trinity College, MS 53,"" JWCI 28 (1965) 86-109, citing this manuscript on pp. 107-108); Sotheby's catalogue, 11 December 1979, lot 46, also links the illumination of the present manuscript with that in two other Winchcombe books (Cambridge, University Library, Mm.3.31; London, Brit. Lib., Cotton Tiberius E.iv). See Ker, MLGB, pp. 198-199 for a list of surviving books from Winchcombe Abbey, including HM 52435 (as Camarillo, Doheny Lib., 50).|Input into Digital Scriptorium by: C. W. Dutschke, 8/23/2012.|This book was still at Winchcombe under the direction of Richard Kidderminster (abbot, 1488-1525), when it received its present binding. Said in the literature (Dawson's typescript description [1950]; Doheny catalogue 1955; Bond and Faye 1962; Christie's sale catalogue 1987) to have belonged to Sir John Prise, a commissioner for the visitation of the monasteries in 1535 and 1539. This ownership seems posited on the fact that Jesus College 102 belonged to Prise and that the two manuscripts (the present one and Jesus College 102) are in very similar bindings. However, the binding of both was certainly done while the books were still at Winchcombe. Moreover, Prise's will directs that his books go to Hereford Cathedral and to Jesus College; neither of the other Winchcombe books that passed by inheritance through the Cope family shows any evidence of ownership by Prise. (See N. R. Ker, ""Sir John Prise,"" The Library, ser. 5, vol. 10 (1955) 1-24, esp. p. 15, listing an Ambrosiaster that did belong to Prise (London, Brit. Lib., Burney 42; whence some of the present confusion?), and pp. 19-20, discussing the Winchcombe origin of the present manuscript in the context of Prise's ownership of Jesus College 102). May have belonged to Sir Walter Cope (see A. G. Watson, ""The Manuscript Collection of Sir Walter Cope (d. 1614),"" Bodleian Library Record 12 (1987) 262-297, discussing this manuscript on pp. 274, 291-292). The book was in the library of the descendants of Sir Anthony Cope, a brother of Sir Walter; it was recorded in the Cope inventory compiled ca. 1772 as n. 6. Sale of Sir Anthony Cope of Bramshill Park, Winchfield, Hampshire, Sotheby's, 4 March 1913, lot 4 to Barnard. On the front pastedown the bookplate of E. F. Bosanquet; his sale, Sotheby's, 24 June 1944, lot 64 to Maggs. Also on the front pastedown, in pencil, the note, ""George A. Goyder, Maltby, Oxford, 1944""; sold by him to Maggs in 1950.
