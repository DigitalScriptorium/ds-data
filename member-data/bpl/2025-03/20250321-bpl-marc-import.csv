According to Max Fisch, the manuscript was originally bound in Augsburg for Pol with four other works. The first of these, Georg of Puerbach, Theoricae novae planetarum [Nuremberg: Johann MÃ¼ller of KÃ¶nigsberg, 1473-4] was sold by Kraus to the Newberry Library, Chicago, Illinois (Fisch, p. 174, nr. 179), and bears the inscription ""Nicolaus Pol Doctor 1494"" as well as the later ex libris, ""Property of the Collegiate Church of Innichen 1632."" Pol's collection of manuscripts, incunables and early sixteenth-century printed books surfaced in the early seventeenth-century in the abbey of San Candido in Innichen (on the Italian/Austrian border).|Provenance 2: When the monastery of San Candido was suppressed by Emperor Josef II in 1735, its possessions were confiscated and inventoried, and many of the books sold at auction. Many Pol manuscripts and incunables surfaced in the stock of Munich bookseller Ludwig Rosenthal in the early twentieth century. The majority of the Rosenthal volumes were purchased in 1907 by Edward Clark Streeter (Boston, Massachusetts) for $800, but it is unlikely that the present volume was among them. While the present manuscript was certainly part of the Innichen collection as part of the bound compilation, it likely remained in the Rosenthal stock after 1907 and was passed to Ludwig's son Heinrich, from whom it was acquired by H. P. Kraus in the 1930s. The bound compilation was offered by Kraus to the Cleveland Medical Library Association sometime before 1940 before being broken into its constituent parts, each of which was sold separately. A pencil note written after 1940 on fol. [1] recto reads ""From the Library of Nicolaus Pol/ formerly bound with nos. 106, 109, 116, 122 and 120 in binding described under 20 in Catalogue no. 20 of H. P. Kraus, no. 120 in Cleveland Medical Library Ass'n."" While the Kraus reference is correct, it is not entirely clear to what the remaining numbers refer (they are not Maggs, Kraus or Fisch numbers).|Immediate source of acquisition: Sold by Kraus to BPL in 1940 (cat. 20, nr. 20, Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts 57052 and 104827).|Call number: MS f Med.103.|Former call number: MS 1531.|Bibliography: Margaret Munsterberg, ""An Unpublished Mathematical Treatise by Simon Bredon,"" More Books XIX (1944): 411; Max Fisch, Nicolaus Pol Doctor 1494 (Cleveland, 1947).

The calendar includes typical Yorkshire saints such as John, Archbishop of York (7 May and Translation, 25 October), Everildis (9 July), William, Archbishop of York (8 August), Wilfridus (12 October and Translation, 24 April), and the Feast of the Relics (9 October, a feastday devoted to the relics of York Minster). The calendar also includes Thomas, Bishop of Herford (2 October), who was canonized in 1320, shortly before the manuscript was written. Throughout the calendar and missal, all references to and liturgy commemorating Thomas Becket were crossed out or scraped away during the Reformation (see, e.g., fol. 160 and 189v).|Provenance: Owned from the fifteenth century by the Gascoigne and de Neville families of Yorkshire, with birth and death notices added to the calendar: William Gascoigne (d. 8 March 1486--his mother was Joan de Neville), his wife Margaret (d. 6 Feb.), his daughters Margaret (b. 29 November ca. 1480?) and Elizabeth (b. 26 July 1476), his sons Thomas (b. 28 Feb. 1477) and Henry (b. 1 July 1482), his sister-in-law Eleanor Delaware (d. 6 Feb.), one Alice Neville (d. 8 May 1481, presumably the Alice Neville who died that year at age 91 and who was William's great-great-grandfather's neice), and others. Around the year 1560, the Gascoigne and Wentworth families were joined by the marriage of Margaret Gascoigne and Thomas Wentworth, the manuscript doubtless coming with Margaret into her new home and remaining with the Wentworth, later Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, families until it was sold in 1953. Bookplate of William Charles de Meuron Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 7th Earl Fitzwilliam (1872-1943), inside front cover. The Earl was a descendant of the Gascoigne and de Neville families, and the family arms on the front and back covers combine the blazons of the Gascoigne (an eel's-head between two bands) and de Neville families with Wentworth (the three lions, seen on the cover and on the bookplate). Several old shelfmarks inside front cover: C.3.6 and W.IV.7.|Immediate source of acquisition: Purchased by BPL in 1956 from Charles W.

Plimpton MS 43, and Baltimore, Walters Art Museum W. 445).|Origin: Written at the Benedictine abbey of St. Martin in Tournai in the early twelfth century. This appears to be nr. 124 in the twelfth-century St. Martin catalogue; see Delisle I:491, where it is described as ""Claudianus de anima in uno volume."" 13th-century St. Martin ex libris on fol. 39v: ""Liber sancti martini tornacensis servanti benedictio amen."" In 1609, the manuscript was studied in Tournai and collated by Jesuit scholar Andreas Schottus; in his autograph inscription on fol. 39v, he notes that he has compared this manuscript to two previous editions (Basel 1520 and Paris 1575) and found it to be superior to both: ""Optimus hic codex est, collatus ad editiones Basiliensem et Parisiensem duplicem, in Bibliotheca SS Patrum, in qua multa et omissa, et corrupta sunt. Hic igitur codex iure optimo cum benedictione servandus; quem contulit accurate editis. And[reas] Schottus Soc. Jesu. An. M.DC.IX Tornaci Nerviorum."" Schottus used this manuscript in preparing his own edition of 1618 (Magna Bibliotheca Vetorum Patrum, V:944, repr. Lyon, 1677, VI:1050). Schottus' collation of this very manuscript is mentioned in several later editions: J. A. Fabricius, Bibliotheca latina mediÃ¦ et infimÃ¦ (1734) I:1075 and Augustus Engelbrecht, Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum (Vienna, 1885) XI:vi.|Provenance 1: The manuscript was still in the Tournai library when the catalogue of 1614 was published, in which it is clearly described as ""Claudiani Mamerci Viennensium Galliae Episcopi de statu Animae Libri 3 longe meliores quam typis per excusi Parisiis, in Biblotheca SS. Patrum Margarini, in qua editione multa & omissa & corrupta sunt quare merito hic codex caute sevandus. Hunc contulit accurrate cum impressis Andr. Schottus Societ. Iesu an. 1609 Tornaci Nerviorum. Praemittitur Libris Claudiani Libellus euiusdam ignoti Authoris de Anima contra quem Claudianus tribus sequentifub Libris disputat."" (Sanderius p. 115, nr. 27).|Provenance 2: Engelbrecht suggests that this may be the Tournai copy of Mamertus purchased from the abbey by Sir Thomas Phillipps in 1824. Later owned by Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Barrois (1784-1855), who apparently had it rebound by Larriviere, who also bound at least two other Barrois manuscripts; Barrois' 1849 sale (n. 97) to Bertram, the Fourth Earl of Ashburnham (1797-1878).

As the former is in modern-day Poland and the latter was a nunnery, neither of these is a likely place of origin for this manuscript, written in a German region in a community of men. Of the abbeys bearing some version of the name ""Paradisus"" listed in Cottineau's RÃ©pertoire topo-bibliographique des abbayes et prieurÃ©s, only the community of Williamites in DÃ¼ren, in the North Rhine region, was a community of men in a Germanic region (Cottineau, I:2187); this seems the most likely point of origin.

Each coat of arms is accompanied by a heraldic description and brief history of the ennobled family. The arms are given in no clear order, although they do appear to be loosely arranged in groups according to the monarch reigning when the particular arms were granted. In its current state, the manuscript is misbound and the leaves have been so often repaired and reattached that there is no way to reconstruct the original sequence. However, offsets onto several leaves from their original facing pages supply a few hints as to the original order: for example, fol. 75v originally faced fol. 22r. Other originally facing pages include 6v/51r, 57v/56r, 58v/64r, 59v/66r, 29v/28r, and 28v/70r. At least one original sequence can therefore be reconstructed; folios 29, 28, and 70 were originally consecutive. The first flyleaf at the end of the volume originally faced f. 42v, implying that that was originally the final leaf of the volume. However, the final flyleaves may have been bound upside-down, since the early note ""544 arms in trick"" on the second-to-last flyleaf is inverted and an upside-down offset on the previous flyleaf matches a coat of arms on fol. 43 recto, a rather difficult arrangement to sort out.|Provenance: Possibly owned in the early eighteenth century by Peter Le NevÃ©, many of whose manuscripts were acquired by the manuscript's first known owner, John Ives; in Le NevÃ©'s 1731 John Wilcox sales catalogue, lot 733 is described as ""Arms of the Nobility since William the Conqueror, in Colours.""

Housed in custom brown slipcase.|Origin: Produced in Saint-Amand (northern France) after the papacy of Callixtus IV, i.e. between 1119-1125, soon after the death of Sigebert of Gembloux in 1112, making this one of the earliest copies of Sigebert's text. Patricia Stirnemann has demonstrated that the manuscript was written in the abbey of Anchin and decorated at Saint-Amand, both in the far North of France. The script is similar to that found in Douai, Bibl. Mun. MS 16, a mid 12th-century manuscript from Anchin, while the decoration is closer to that produced in Saint-Amand, in particular Valenciennes, Bibl. Mun. 1, 48, 112, and 132 (ILLUSTRATE Valenciennes Bib. Mun. 1). McCusker relates this copy to the ""B"" group as defined in the MGH edition, descended from a manuscript copied by the Flemish monk Anchin, a contemporary of Sigebert's, ca. 1112-1113 (McCusker, p. 98). McCusker assumes that the present manuscript probably originally included Anchin's additions.

The breviary must have been written after the year 1317, since the calendar includes the feast of St. Louis of Toulouse, canonized that year. It was written for Franciscan use, as evidenced by the calendar which includes the following Franciscan feasts: Translation of St. Francis (25 May), St. Anthony (13 June, in red), St. Clare (12 August, in red), St. Francis (4 October, in red), the Octave of St. Francis (11 October, in red), and Bishop Louis of Toulouse (19 August).

The calendar includes several Flemish and northern French saints: Bertinus (5 September), Firminus of Amiens (25 September), Amandus (26 October), Winocus (6 November), Martin (11 November, in red), Bricius (13 November). In addition, the litany includes Gangericus and Vulmarus, saints venerated in that region, and the Office of the Dead is for the use of Tournai.

Moris, fol. 1-143; (unidentified hand I), fol. 144-163; (unidentified hand II) fol. 164-190. Part III: written in a ca. 17th-century cursive hand in brown ink.|Decoration: Spaces left for two- to four-line initials unfilled (guide letters only). The tree of battle illustration in brown ink on f. 5v.|Binding: Bound ca. 1471 in blind stamped calf over wooden boards. Spine with raised bands, ruled in blind. Three paper labels are present. The primary label contains a manuscript list of contents in a ca. 19th-century hand (""Arbre de batailles / The libel of English / policy / &c. / MS""). Conservation treatment in 2018 revealed that the underside of the parchment hinge at front contains two lines in a medieval French hand. In 1936, Dr. Robin Flower, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum, attributed this binding to the Abbey of St. Peter of Hasnon. Currently housed in a tan cloth box.|Origin: The contents of parts I (fol. 1-163v) and II (fol. 164-190v) were written in the mid-15th century. Part I was written in Calais by the scribe V.C. Moris (see colophon, fol. 143). Part II was written in England, but on both French and Italian paper stocks. Part III consists of 8 tipped-in leaves of mid-17th-century manuscript materials in various hands, all likely produced in England. The retention of the binder's flyleaves between parts I and II suggests that each part may have previously been bound separately.|Provenance 1: This volume contains three autographs of one ""Willelmo Caston,"" conjectured by some to be William Caxton, the first English printer. These inscriptions are present on fol. 1 (""Iste liber co[n]stat Will[el]mo Caston""), fol. 143, and on the rear pastedown. N.F. Blake suggests that this autograph is more likely attributable to a different man: William Caston, a member of the English Staple at Calais, whose documented presence in the area is roughly contemporaneous to that of Caxton's time in Bruges.|Provenance 2: In 1471 ""Willelmo Caston"" gave the volume to William Sonnyng, who appended this information to the inscription on fol. 1 (""...quy dedit Will[el]mo Son[n]yng Anâ° m[^i]iiij[^c]lxxj""). William Sonnyng's name also appears on the front and rear pastedowns. The book was then passed to Sonnyng's son and grandson (both named John). The autograph of the elder John Sonnyng, dated ""anno 1522 le 23 Juin"" is appended to his father's autograph on the rear pastedown. In 1528, the younger John Sonnyng presented the volume to Thomas Wall, Windsor Herald, adding to the inscriptoin on fol. 1: ""...qui genuit Johannem qui genuit Johannem quem Johannes de ordinies sancti francisci dedit istius liber thome wall alias windesor herald aâ° 1528."" Later, the volume was likely owned by Henry Spelman (d. 1641), whose collection was purchased by Cox Macro in 1709/10. The Macro collection was purchased by John Patteson. Hudson Gurney purchased the volume from Patteson in 1820 (Christie's, Feb. 1820, lot 68). H. Gurney passed it on to J.H. Gurney (his ""VII"" label on spine), who passed it on to Q.E. Gurney (d. 1932). The volume was then purchased by Maggs through Sotheby's on March 30, 1936 (lot 146).|Immediate source of acquisition: Purchased by the BPL from Maggs, of London, in 1939.|Call number: MS f Med.92.|Former call number: MS 1519.|Bibliography: Honor McCusker, ""A Book from Caxton's Library.""

The hand of Stephen Dodesham has been identified in twenty manuscripts (see Doyle, p. 115), including two other copies of The Siege of Thebes (Beinecke Library MS 661 and Cambridge University Library Add. MS 3137). Although he was late in life a Carthusian at Witham in Somerset and then at Sheen, near London, it seems likely that Dodesham copied the three manuscripts of Thebes previous to taking his vows, when he was working as a lay scribe. The manuscripts were copied at different times from one another, however, based on different exemplars (Doyle, p. 101).|Provenance: An early owner (possibly the first) has written several inscriptions on fol. 76: ""Te deum laudamus te dominum confitemur"" twice, and ""Pour dieu Remembres Vous de moy/Remembres Vouys de moy pour dieu"" Doyle believed this hand to be English (Bawcutt, p. 81). Belonged to the Lyle family at the end of the 15th century, who owned estates near Renfrewshire, just west of Glasgow in Scotland. Inscriptions on fol. 75 mention a ""Robert Lyle"" and a ""Mareota Lylle."" Another on that same leaf reads ""Memorandum that Robert lylle borruyt a buk/fra marown lylle lade off huston/&Robert lylles hed & xxxv."" Bawcutt tentatively identifies this Robert Lyle as Robert, second Lord Lyle (d. 1498/9; Bawcutt, p. 81). Mariota was his daughter, married to Peter Houston. In the 16th century, the manuscript apparently belonged to the Swinton family, whose estate was near Berwick upon Tweed and Norham. The inscription ""Ihone Swyntoun/ with my hand finis"" is found on fol. 1, but this John Swinton has yet to be identified. Another inscription from the same era on fol. 1 reads ""liber Donald."" (Bawcutt, p. 83) Belonged to Duncan Campbell, seventh laird of Glenorchy (ca. 1552-1631), inscribed on fol. 74: ""This Bwik pertenis to ane Richt honorabill/Sir Duncane Campbell of/Glennorquhay Knycht"" (see Bawcutt, pp. 83 ff.). The manuscript remained in the family at their estate at Taymouth Castle, Perthshire, through the 19th century. It is listed as no. 2300 in the handwritten 1863 inventory of books and manuscripts belonging to the Marquess of Breadalbane (National Archives of Scotland, MS GD 112/ 22/ 56). Sold by the family at Sotheby's on 16 June 1941 to L. and P. Robinson.|Immediate source of acquisition: Purchased by the BPL from L. and P.

Otherwise, in excellent condition, with bright colors and little fading or rubbing.|Collation: Parchment, vertical scroll in 16 sheets pasted together with approximately 15 mm overlap. 10380 x 505 mm (upper margin: 183 mm; outer margins: 35 mm).|Layout: Two (183 mm) or four (85 mm) columns (one brief section in which the fourth column splits into two narrow columns). Bounding and ruling lines in blind, prickings along each edge. Several sheets have a crease in the center from edge to edge, implying that they were once folded in half, probably to facilitate pricking.|Script: Written in a gothic cursive script in brown ink. Rubrics and captions sometimes in slightly smaller script.|Decoration: Genealogical diagrams throughout of 25 mm red roundels with captions in brown ink within, linked by red lines. Opens with four-line initial in blue on gold-leaf background with infill in gold and colors, one- to two-line initials throughout in gold with salmon infill on blue or vice versa, white geometric tracery. Border of vines with gold and blue acanthus in upper left corner. 56 miniatures (57-65 x 50-55 mm) extant, with two miniatures cut away and several miniatures lacking at end (the first twelve square or rectangular, the remainder round medallions). Manuscript B is thought by Francois Avril to have been illuminated in a style ""popular in a large swath from the northeast to the southeast of what is currently France."" (See Hedeman, 2010, note.1).|Formerly attached to wooden spindles, 645 mm long. Upper spindle was possibly original; lower spindle was a 19th-century replacement with two narrow gray ribbons attached at the center. Scroll was attached to upper spindle by a wedge running the length of the spindle, and to lower spindle by adhesive. Currently housed in a custom cloth case.|Origin: Produced in France ca. 1470s.|Provenance: Owned by Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Barrois (1784-1855). Presumably sold to the Earl of Ashburnham (1797-1878) with the rest of the Barrois collection in 1849, although the manuscript is not listed in the Barrois catalogue. His sale, Sotheby's London, 10 June 1901, lot 626 to Sydney Cockerell for the Boston Public Library (Barrois-Ashburnham lot number ""626"" written in blue pencil on verso of fifteenth sheet, before the silk repair was applied).|Immediate source of acquisition: Acquired by the Boston Public Library in March 1903 from Sydney Cockerell.|Call number: MS pb Med.32.|Former call number: G.Cab.3.31.|Bibliography: Haraszti, Z.

Branner, in Manuscript Painting in Paris, attributes this manuscript to the ""middle period"" of the eponymous du Prat atelier (Branner, p. 78-80 and 218)|Provenance: According to Peter Kidd, ""the unidentified words and paraphs on the first pages of the original two volumes (now vols.I and III) show that this comes from the library at the Chateau d'Anet, which was sold in 1724 after the death of Anne of Bavaria. (The characteristic marks consist of a number followed by a paraph, the former sometimes written in words in French, sometimes in numerals.) The Bible is therefore doubtless the very first item of the catalogue."" (unpublished correspondence)|Provenance 2: The manuscript was divided into four volumes when bound in the current 18th-century boards, with unidentified gilt monogram stamps in the corners and spine compartments of the bindings. In the Sotheby's sale of 7 June 1932, these are tentatively identified as the monogram of Joseph Bonnier, Baron de la Mosson (1702-44), although comparison of the stamps to the Bonnier monogram reproduced in A. Bouvenne, Les monogrammes historiques (Paris, 1870), p. 37, suggests that this identification is spurious; the monogram stamps remain unidentified.|Provenance 3: Later owned by JosÃ© Antonio Conde y GarcÃ­a (1766-1820), Librarian of the Royal Library, Madrid: the Bible was lot 970 in his sale by [Robert Harding] Evans, Catalogue of Rare, Curious, and Interesting Spanish Books, and a Few Miscellaneous Articles, Forming the Library of Don.

A number of miniatures have been attributed to Francesco da Castello (fol. 1, 40v, 58v, 64v, 72v). Several miniatures had been previously attributed to Bartolomeo Gossi da Gallarate, but recently Luca Di Palma and Maria Bollati have concluded that he did not in fact contribute to this manuscript; Luca Di Palma has attributed the initials on fol. 41v, 46v, 50, and 54 to the Second Master of the San Sisto Choirbooks (private correspondence).|Provenance: In 1810, when the Napoleonic decree suppressing religious orders reached the monastery, the set of 14 choirbooks to which the present manuscript belongs were hidden in the attic of the family home of a monk named Benedetto Affaticati. They were sold by one of his descendants in 1864 to private collector Michele Cavaleri. Cavaleri sold the manuscripts to Enrico Cernuschi, who transported the manuscripts to Paris, where they remained until his death in 1896. A small paper label in the upper left corner inside the front cover, possibly dating from this period, numbers this manuscript ""6"" (the same label is found in BPL MS pf Med.97).|Immediate source of acquisition: Purchsed from L'Art Ancien in 1940.|Call number: MS pf Med.120.|Former call number: M.Cab.2.51.|Bibliography: ""Library notes: exhibition of illuminated manuscripts.""

In 1810, when the Napoleonic decree suppressing religious orders reached the monastery, the set of 14 choirbooks to which the present manuscript belongs were hidden in the attic of the family home of a monk named Benedetto Affaticati. They were sold by one of his descendents in 1864 to private collector Michele Cavaleri. Cavaleri sold the manuscripts to Enrico Cernuschi, who transported the manuscripts to Paris, where they remained until his death in 1896. A small paper label in the upper left corner inside the front cover, possibly dating from this period, numbers this manuscript ""4"" (the same label is found in BPL MS pf Med.120). Another early shelfmark inside the front cover reads ""III.15"". After Cernuschi's collection was sold in 1897 by Hiersemann, the location of the choirbooks was lost (see Overty, p. 151). The present manuscript resurfaced when it was sold by Jacques Rosenthal in 1902 (cat. 27, no. 73 with plate) to Maurice Kann of Paris, who sold the manuscript in 1913 to R. Forrer of Strassburg (German notes inside front cover presumably his).|Immediate source of acquisition: Purchased in May, 1940, from Julius Hess (Bern), his Cat. 1 (1935), no. 5.|Call number: MS pf Med.97.|Former call number: MS 1524.|Bibliography: ""Library notes: exhibition of illuminated manuscripts.""

The Office of St. Francis is that composed by Julian of Speyer around the year 1235, and, as recorded in this manuscript, originally gave the following text of the first responsory of Matins (fol. 162): ""Hic vir in vanitatibus nutritus in decenter/ plus suis nutritoribus se gesset insolenter"" (""He was raised shamefully, amid all sorts of folly, and as he grew up he surpassed those who raised him in even worse folly""). Because it was felt that this text reflected poorly on the Saint, the second line was altered in 1260 by decree of the head of the Order to read ""...divinis carismatibus praeventer est clementer."" (...but by God's grace he mercifully kept himself free of contamination). Although this manuscript has always been thought to have been written after 1260 because of the use of the altered text (see BPL quarterly, p. 82), the original text is in fact visible under ultraviolet light, indicating that the manuscript must have been written before 1260 and altered after that date.|Provenance: 15th-century annotations on fol. 168v.

Her husband's arms (Ralph of Wilington) appear on fol. 26 and 34. Michaels (p. 21) argues that the Label across the top of the Wilington arms on fol. 26 suggests that the manuscript dates from after Eleanor's marriage (date uncertain, but sometime between 1324-1337) but before her husband Ralph had come into his inheritance, which occurred in 1338. The text of the manuscript reflects continued feminine use, with ""famulam tuam"" found both in the original section of the manuscript (fol. 52v) and in the later fifteenth-century additions (fol. 114v).|Provenance 1: Signature Peter le Neve (1661-1729), verso of front flyleaf, dated 1699.

Peter Kidd notes that Ludwig Rosenthal Catalogue 135 (1910), no. 300, describes a substantially similar bible: ""Biblia Latina. Manuscrit de la fin du 13 ou du commencement du 14 siÃ¨cle s. vÃ©lin.

The original manuscript eventually passed, apparently intact, to LÃ©on or Paul Gruel, Paris book dealers and binders, who removed most of the Old Testament text and rebound the remainder into a single volume of 187 leaves. Purchased from Gruel before ca. 1930 by Sir Alfred Chester Beatty (cf. Chester Beatty Archives). Thereafter Chester Beatty W. MS. VIII, then foliated and renumbered as Western MS 116 by Eric Millar for his intended catalog (Peter Kidd, private correspondence, July, 2019). Chester Beatty sale, Sotheby's, 3 December, 1968, lot 14, to booksellers Alan G. Thomas and Charles Ede (SDBM 3163). Subsequently broken up and sold as single leaves and in groups of leaves. This fragment appeared in Thomas' catalog 22, no. 1(d). Later owned by Brian Douglas Stilwell (his bookplate tipped to front pastedown). Sold by the William H.

The autograph of ""N. Pauli"" -- possibly one of the scribes or an early owner -- appears on fol. 171 and 182. Localization to western Germany is based on textual and liturgical evidence. For example, the invitatorium ""In honore beatissime virgo maria"" is associated with Germany and the Northern netherlands, while the antiphon and capitulum in Prime are associated with Siegburg, located approximately 30 kilometers southeast of Cologne. The calendar and litany include a number of saints venerated in German lands and in Cologne specifically, as well as saints Willebrord and Odulf, venerated in Utrecht. These strong associations with Germany, the inclusion of Utrecht saints, and the presence of a Middle Dutch recipe on fol. 171v (see contents note) suggest that this book of hours was created somewhere between Cologne and the German side of the Dutch border. The date of 1411 is attested by a series of chronological calculations on fol. 181, written in a different hand than any of the other sections, and which mark the number of years from the Creation, Adam, Eve, the Flood, and the Incarnation. Dating is further supported by watermark evidence (see reference to Briquet in the collation note). That the manuscript was copied for or used by a woman is suggested by feminine endings in several prayers (see, for example, 180v) and by the addition, in a different hand, of a prayer to Saint Margaret, though masculine endings can also be found throughout.|Provenance: Modern pencil dealer's notes on front pastedown.

According to a dated verse colophon (fol. 136v), the manuscript was completed on January 1, 1467 (1468 new style). Evidence of Augustinian use includes the appearance of St. Augustine as ""Sancte pater"" in the litanies; the feast (28 August) and octave (4 September) of St. Augustine are written in red in the calendar, as are the translation (9 April) and feast (4 May) of his mother, St. Monica. St. Monica also occupies the final position among the virgins in the litanies. The inclusion in red in the calendar of St. Reparata (8 October), patron saint of Florence, and St. Minias (25 October), the first Christian martyr of Florence, as well as St. Zenobius (25 May), the first bishop of Florence, in gray, indicate that the manuscript was made for use in Florence, or its diocese (Reparata and Zenobius both also included in the litanies). Liturgical evidence more specifically suggests the manuscript was made for an Augustinian nun at the at the convent of Santa Caterina del Monte (San Gaggio) in Florence. St. Catherine of Alexandria's name is written in capital letters and touched in yellow in the litany, and her octave (2 December) is also included in red in the calendar. St. Caius is included in the calendar (22 April) and at the end of the martyrs in the litanies. This Augustinian convent was initially founded in the first half of the fourteenth century as Santa Caterina del Monte, dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria. In 1353 it was united with the Augustinian convent dedicated to the pope, St. Caius.|Provenance: On fol. 136v, a note dated 1655, but otherwise faded to illegibility.

The Lady ChasnÃ© appears in the manuscript wearing a green gown, on fol. 136v, 143, and 148. Booten does not definitely identify the bride and groom, although the bride's name apparently began with the letter [M], the monogram in the lower margin of fol. 143.

The two extra miniatures likely refer to the two blank spaces found on folios 20 and 70 (tipped-in leaves), where miniatures were apparently meant to be.|Decoration (secondary): Fully decorated borders throughout the manuscript. Black vines with golden leaves, acanthus leaves, fruits, flowers, and other plants (often clustered in block patterns). Gold, blue and red lines on the outer edges of text columns, frequently with flowers and plants sprouting out from top of line. A variety of different hands working on the borders, evident from the wide range of foliage.|Decoration (tertiary): One- to three-line initials throughout the manuscript. Three-line decorated initials, often with intertwined vines and flowers, accompany every miniature (except miniature on fol. 74). Three initials with unidentified coats of arms: fol. 29 (Hours of the Virgin, Matins), fol. 124 (Penitential Psalms), fol. 148 (Office of the Dead, Matins). The coats of arms consist of gold and red stripes with five birds in profile on the left, a gray diamond pattern in upper right, and a gold fleur-de-lis pattern in lower right with red background.|Binding: Modern vellum conservation binding. Housed in a tan cloth clamshell case, brown gilt-stamped labels on spine: ""Livre d'heures/XV Century"" and ""MS Q. MED. 89."" Previously bound in nineteenth-century brown morocco leather by ""NiderÃ©e"" in Paris, France, with large brass clasps added in 1857 (Census Supplement). Clasps engraved by Joseph Whitney's son with his initials and date. Engravings reads: [top clasp] ""Missal of the XIV Century""; [bottom clasp] ""H.A.W. from my Father Joseph Whitney Jany. 1st, 1857."" On the inside of the back cover of the nineteenth-century binding is a newspaper clipping from the Christian Inquirer (New York), dated Saturday, December 20, 1856, entitled ""A Remarkable Manuscript."" This article describes an exhibition of the manuscript at the New York Historical Society by ""Dr. Osgood."" Both bindings shelved together.|Origin: Illuminated in Northern France in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. Likely meant for the use of Poitiers. Many of the landscapes and compositions in the miniature cycles are similar in style to those created by the Workshop of the Boucicaut Master.|Provenance: Appeared in the catalog of the German dealer J.M.C. Armbruster in September 1852 (no. 2597). Exhibited at the New York Historical Society by ""Dr. Osgood"" and sold to Joseph Whitney in 1856 (reported in the Christian Inquirer on December 20, 1856).|Immediate source of acquisition: Purchased in October 1940 from Joseph Whitney's grandson, George H. Whitney. On the flyleaf at the front of the manuscript is the following text in pencil: ""Josiah H. Benton / Dec. 24, 1940 / L.""|Call number: MS q Med.89.|Former call number: MS 1516.|Bibliography: Nancy Netzer, ed., Secular/Sacred 11th-16th Century Works from the Boston Public Library and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Boston College, 2006), no. 83.","",2025-04-15 09:43:28 -0400,20240522,20250321-bpl-marc.xml

Med./ No. 90"".|Origin: Produced in Brittany for the use of a woman around the year 1425. The Hours of the Virgin suggests the use of St-Brieuc (on the northern coast of Brittany), while the Office of the Dead points to DÃ´l, some 50 miles to the east. The calendar includes saints that also point to both locations: St. Sansonis, Bishop of DÃ´l (in red, 28 July), and St. William, Bishop of St-Brieuc (in red, 29 July). The litany is equally ambiguous. Either way, the manuscript was certainly produced in Brittany for the use of a woman (see the feminine usage in ""Obsecro te"").|Provenance: Bound in the Grolier style in the mid-sixteenth century for an unidentified patron, presumably with the initials ""A.M."" as found on both covers. Belonged to Dutch Reformed minister Petrus Hofstede (1716-1803), according to a description pasted inside the front cover written by the next (unidentified) owner in 1804: ""Plenitudo legis dilectio sine anno mss splendidissimi in membr. cum lineis rubris litteris et eloquentissimi fig. colori[ ]as et auro depictis et illustratis, lig. gall. - Ex Bibliotheca Hofstediana a[nno] 1804 in meam transiit."" The manuscript was not included in the Hofstede sale of 1804, as that sale included only printed books (see Bibliotheca Hofstediana (Rotterdam, 1804)). Later belonged to William Bragge of Birmingham (1823-1884), his sale Sotheby's 7 June 1876, lot 230, to B. Quaritch. Offered by Quaritch, cat. 31 (30 June 1876), lot 86, description pasted inside front cover with ownership inscription added, ""Purchased by C. Lq from B Quaritch Dec. 28 1876"". This ""C.

The decoration in this manuscript is substantially similar to illuminated initials and borders attributed to Ser Ricciardo di Nanni. Ricciardo di Nanni and his workshop contributed to other manuscripts copied by the Ottoboni Livy Master, including the Vatican Library's Vat.lat.1743.

Historiated initial of King David on fol. 14; on fol. 128v, the Prophet Isaiah. Single-line initials rubricated in alternating red and blue.

Several bar borders of gold and colors accented with penwork and foliage in gold and colors.|Binding: Bound in ca. 18th-century red goatskin, gilt. Green gilt spine label.|Origin: Apparently copied in the 1460s for use of the Carthusian Charterhouse in Ferrara. Association with the Carthusians is demonstrated through inclusion in the calendar of the feasts of St. Hugh of Lincoln (17 November) and St. Hugh of Grenoble (1 April); the specification of ""[cum] candelis"" for important feast days, repeated throughout the calendar, is unique to Carthusian practice, and the commemoration of the dead brothers of the Carthusians (9 November) is elevated in red. Finally, the rubric for the Office of the Virgin on fol. 293 specifies that it is for the Carthusian order. Decoration also presents evidence that links this manuscript to the Ferrarese Carthusians. In particular, illuminations can be attributed to a follower of Guglielmo Girardi, who worked on manuscripts created for San Cristoforo alla Certosa in Ferrara (see Decoration note). This charterhouse was founded by Duke Borso d'Este and construction was completed in 1461. A date of production between 1460 and 1470 is supported by evidence in the calendar. The Visitation on July 2, made a solemn feast in 1468, is not a solemnity (i.e., ""cum candelis"") in the present manuscript. The feast of The Presentation on November 21, permitted in 1470 and made mandatory by the Carthusians, is not included.|Provenance: Formerly in the collection of Lucien Magne (1849-1916), thereafter by descent.
