According to Max Fisch, the manuscript was originally bound in Augsburg for Pol with four other works. The first of these, Georg of Puerbach, Theoricae novae planetarum [Nuremberg: Johann MÃ¼ller of KÃ¶nigsberg, 1473-4] was sold by Kraus to the Newberry Library, Chicago, Illinois (Fisch, p. 174, nr. 179), and bears the inscription ""Nicolaus Pol Doctor 1494"" as well as the later ex libris, ""Property of the Collegiate Church of Innichen 1632."" Pol's collection of manuscripts, incunables and early sixteenth-century printed books surfaced in the early seventeenth-century in the abbey of San Candido in Innichen (on the Italian/Austrian border).|Provenance 2: When the monastery of San Candido was suppressed by Emperor Josef II in 1735, its possessions were confiscated and inventoried, and many of the books sold at auction. Many Pol manuscripts and incunables surfaced in the stock of Munich bookseller Ludwig Rosenthal in the early twentieth century. The majority of the Rosenthal volumes were purchased in 1907 by Edward Clark Streeter (Boston, Massachusetts) for $800, but it is unlikely that the present volume was among them. While the present manuscript was certainly part of the Innichen collection as part of the bound compilation, it likely remained in the Rosenthal stock after 1907 and was passed to Ludwig's son Heinrich, from whom it was acquired by H. P. Kraus in the 1930s. The bound compilation was offered by Kraus to the Cleveland Medical Library Association sometime before 1940 before being broken into its constituent parts, each of which was sold separately. A pencil note written after 1940 on fol. [1] recto reads ""From the Library of Nicolaus Pol/ formerly bound with nos. 106, 109, 116, 122 and 120 in binding described under 20 in Catalogue no. 20 of H. P. Kraus, no. 120 in Cleveland Medical Library Ass'n."" While the Kraus reference is correct, it is not entirely clear to what the remaining numbers refer (they are not Maggs, Kraus or Fisch numbers).|Immediate source of acquisition: Sold by Kraus to BPL in 1940 (cat. 20, nr. 20, Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts 57052 and 104827).|Call number: MS f Med.103.|Former call number: MS 1531.|Bibliography: Margaret Munsterberg, ""An Unpublished Mathematical Treatise by Simon Bredon,"" More Books XIX (1944): 411; Max Fisch, Nicolaus Pol Doctor 1494 (Cleveland, 1947).
