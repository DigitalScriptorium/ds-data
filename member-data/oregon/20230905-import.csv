Right figure is an angel holding a Tau cross and a sword. The figure beneath this angel has a halo, puts a palm to their face, and reads a book. The figure at the bottom left corner also has a halo, holds a leaf of parchment, and points toward a bird to the right of the figure. If bird is an eagle, this figure may be John. Beneath this figure is a non-human figure with three horns (?) on a horse. The bottom-center illustration shows an angel with a key in one hand and a rope in the other. The other end of the rope is attached to a collar that a monstrous figure wears. This figure has a furry face, a large, straight central horn and two auxiliary ram-like horns. This figure also appears to have pendulous breasts and a scale-like abdomen. These two figures are set against a rocky landscape. The bottom-right illustration shows a naked figure pouring two jars of a liquid into a body of water. The bottom design features a bird in the center with its wings spread. The left column is heavily decorated in a foliate design. A child-like figure stands posed on a capital-like base. Leaf is signed ""g.iiii."" at bottom right.|Verso: text enclosed within an extremely elaborate and detailed border. Top left figure depicts Saint Lawrence of Rome, identified by the book he holds in one hand, the gridiron he holds in the other, and the dalmatic attire. Left column features a stippled (criblé) and foliate design with three floating heads at the ends of the foliage. Top head is possibly Saint Helena, given the royal-like attire. The second head wears a helmet that obscures most of the face. The third head is bearded and wears a hat. At the bottom of this column is a figure wearing a foliate-like hat, and riding a horse. Beneath this column is a breasted figure with wings on either side of the head. A similar figure is at the bottom of the right column. Between these two figures is a neo-gothic crenellation design with a face in the center. The center illustration features two winged dragons back-to-back, spewing a foliate design. A ram appears in a separate framed illustration to the left of this bottom illustration. The right column is a thistle-like foliate design with a naked child at the top and bottom of the column. The top frame design is similar to the recto, but has a dome-like design at the ends.",,2023-09-21 17:48:17 -0400,2022-03-05,20230905-oregon-marcxml.xml
