No attribution is given in the ms.  The beginning of the text is missing.  This work is ascribed variously to Richard Maidstone (or Maydestone) and Richard Rolle (cf.

In the past it has generally been attributed to Richard Rolle, but this attribution is not certain.  This version of the text of the Pricke of Conscience is the ""Main Version"" from Group III (S. A. Waters).|Upper cover and two endleaves detached.  Back hinge wearing.  Outer margin on f. 80 cut away with no loss of main text but perhaps removing a marginal note.
