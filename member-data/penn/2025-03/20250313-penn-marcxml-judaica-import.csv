The portion of text ascertaining the time of the arrival of the Messiah is written in a larger semicursive script, with a more Italian appearance and a lower slant, probably by another hand (f. 2r).

The dating of the manuscript is based on Yaḥya's friendship with a R. Natan Spira (f. 7r); likely a reference to R. Natan Note Spira of Kraków, a famed kabbalist and author of Megaleh ʻamuḳot, who lived 1585-1633. Also, the poem Yedid nefesh is attributed in this manuscript (f. 3r) to R. Eleazar Azikri (1533-1600), who printed it for the first time in 1600-1 in a volume he authored (Sefer ḥaredim, Venice: Daniel Zanetti, 1600-1601).|No binding; fragile remnants of sewing.

Fol. 1 of the fragment contains, parallel to the Hebrew version (in Goldschmidt and Frenḳl, Maḥazor le-Shavuʹot / Yonah Frenḳel, E.D. Goldschmidt [ed.s].

Sometimes ל of the definite article, when it is to be assimilated with the following letter, is entirely omitted. Thus النيرن = אניואן, the ו and י are often used to represent short u and i, respectively, as for instance, يخرج = יוכרגו ; or عشر = עושר ; or باى = בולי (metre demands the reading bula); or انا = אינא ; or فاذا = פאידא. As a rule no diacritical marks are used. Only ظ is a few times represented by ט֯, and ض by צ֯. One word is vocalized in a peculiar wat, and doubtless represents the vulgar Arabic pronunciation in Tiberian vowels. It is الخار = אלגַאִיר (the vocalization would suggest الخاىًر). The following line may be given as a specimen of the metre: ان بغت من بنات هرون انثى حرقت فى توقد النيران = אן בגת מן בנאת הרון אנתא חרקת פי תוקד אניראן.|See the description by S.

The pronunciation, however, indicated by the vowels, is not classical, and in many cases the scribe displays ingnorance of elementary rules of Arabic grammar.
