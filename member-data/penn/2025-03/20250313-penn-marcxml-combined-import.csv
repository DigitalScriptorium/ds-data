No attribution is given in the ms. The beginning of the text is missing. This work is ascribed variously to Richard Maidstone (or Maydestone) and Richard Rolle (cf. Zacour-Hirsch Catalogue).|Title of second work as given in the ms.: Stimulus conscie[ncie] (colophon, f. 118r). There is no attribution in the manuscript. In the past it has generally been attributed to Richard Rolle, but this attribution is not certain. This version of the text of the Pricke of Conscience is the ""Main Version"" from Group III (S. A. Waters).|Third work has no title in the ms. Text may be incomplete, since it ends abruptly without a colophon. There is no attribution in the ms. This is the only known ms. version of this work, which appears never to have been published. It is a homiletic poem of 200 octosyllabic verses. It appears to be based on St. Anselm of Canterbury's ""Deploratio male amissae virginitatis.""|Incipit of third work: Qwhan drighten dere his doom schal dresse / And alle oure dedys demen on a day ...
