The translation of Saint Erkenwald, founder of Chertsey Abbey and later bishop of London, is underlined in red and accorded 9 lections (14 November). His relics were moved to their shrine on the east side of the wall behind the high altar of St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1148. The Office of the Dead is of the Use of Sarum. The Litany, however, has a distinct flavour of York, invoking (among others) the names of Saints Paulinus of York, John of Beverley, Wilfrid of York, William of York, Hilda of Whitby, and Everilda of Everingham, Yorkshire. The manuscript may have been made in London for a customer from the north. The manuscript comprises: a Calendar (fol. 1r), graded with up to 9 lections, which is for secular rather than monastic use; a ferial Psalter (fol. 7r) with canticles (from fol. 115r) and Litany (fol. 126r); and the Office of the Dead (fol.131v), all ending on fol. 138r.","",2024-11-04 11:19:03 -0500,2011-11-06T01:57:54,ds_50_40_00153524.xml
