Features of the Vrelant style include distance in landscape measured by receding sizes of little round bushes and use of a deep metallic blue paint, especially for clothes. Like many Netherlandish artists, right through to the seventeenth century and later, Bruges illuminators transform even sacred scenes into homely and domestic settings.

The Calendar from fol. 3r is graded, and includes the dedications of the chapel of Saints Giles and George (1 March) and other chapels and the dedication of the church (on Jubilate Sunday, the third after Easter). It has Saint Augustine (28 August, with octave) and the translation of Saint Augustine (11 October) as totum duplex. The maxims on charity in the scrolls in the margin of fol. 240v cite Saint Augustine. The manuscript also has Saint Mary Magdalene as totum duplex (22 July, with octave) and the Conversion of Mary Magdalene (1 March). The text points unambiguously to Hildesheim, with Saint Bernward, bishop of Hildesheim 993-1022, as duplex (20 November) and his translation underlined in red (16 August). There can be no doubt that the Breviary was made for use in the Augustinian nunnery of Sankt Maria Magdalena in Hildesheim. A list of 15 members of the convent in March 1494 includes a Sister E. Walmden, who must be the nun who commissioned this manuscript (Doebner 1904, p. 241).

The book is likely to have been made elsewhere, perhaps in France, and acquired by Cambron after it was written. Tiny sewing-holes beside and above the initials indicate that they were once protected by textile flaps. The large initial here shows an ostrich holding in its beak what appears to be a snake. The snake may be a visual misunderstanding of a horseshoe, with which ostriches were often shown in medieval heraldry, because they were reputed to eat iron. The unusual subject has a specific relevance to Philippians. The twelfth-century Bestiary text recounts that ostriches forget where they have laid their eggs. It explains this trait as being a symbol of the Christian who should forget earthly matters and focus instead on the prize of the higher calling, “ad bravium supernae vocationis”, in Latin (Barber 1999, p. 138).

It was seized by Pius II (1458-64), restored by Sixtus IV (1471-84), and purchased by Gregory XIII (1572-85). The manuscript might have passed through the papal library, which may explain the seventeenth-century spine title Psalterium Vaticanum but this could also mean no more than a superficial resemblance to other famous manuscripts in Beneventan minuscule from Montecassino now mostly in the Vatican Library. Several defective or partial leaves, edges worn. Many pages with old repairs using pieces from an eleventh-century liturgical manuscript in Beneventan minuscule and from a thirteenth-century legal manuscript. Lowe 1962 said that other pieces of this manuscript were in the Hayes Collection in Chicago, which is apparently an error (the Hayes Collection is now at the University of Colorado in Boulder, and no Beneventan leaves are known to have been part of it). There are, however, two other fragments in Beneventan minuscule in the Lilly Library, Ricketts 58 (F. 46), pieces from an early thirteenth-century Missal, and Ricketts 160 (F. 160), two leaves from Augus-tine on John, c. 1100, in script of the Bari type.|Bibliography: De Ricci 1935, p. 603; Halporn 1961, esp. pp. 220-24; Faye and Bond 1962, p. 179; Lowe 1962, p. 216; Brown 1978, p. 279; Brown 1995, p. 14, n. 2; Baroffio 1999, p. 25.|ff. 1-108: Other manuscripts written in Beneventan minuscule from San Domenico in Sora are Vatican, BAV, Cod. Reg. Lat. 334, and Oxford, Bodleian, MS Douce 127. Both invoke Saint Dominic in their litanies, fols. 31r and 118r respectively. It is likely that Poole 19 was made in Sora itself, although the late Virginia Brown noted that the hand looks more like that associated with the neighbouring region of Abruzzo, east of Sora, and the scribe may have trained elsewhere or was perhaps recruited for the monastery’s rededication in 1104.|ff. 1-108: Latin.|ff. 1-108: Includes canticles and litany. Opens imperfectly imperfectly at psalm 6: 4, followed by the canticles, marked up later for liturgical use, a litany, and short prayers (for oneself, fol. 97v, for weekday use, fol. 101r, etc.); a replacement leaf with the opening of the Office of the Dead, now fol. 100, may reflect a final text, once at the end. The names of monks and hermits open with Saint Benedict, written in red, and they end with Saint Dominic. The women’s names conclude with Saints Restituta and Scholastica, sister of Saint Benedict. Dominic at this date cannot be the founder of the Black Friars (he was born in 1170 and was canonised in 1234). It must be Saint Dominic of Foligno (d. 1031), who founded the Benedictine abbey at Sora, in the province of Lazio between Rome and Naples, just within the border of Benevento. The abbey was reconsecrated by Pope Paschal II in 1104 and was dedicated to Saint Dominic. As Saint Restituta is the patron saint of the town of Sora, the manuscript was presumably made for the monastery.","",2024-11-04 11:19:03 -0500,2011-11-06T01:29:24,ds_50_40_00153477.xml

A comparable Latin Bible, from Genesis to Psalms, is Vienna, ÖNB, Cod. 1187, illuminated in Vienna around 1440 by the Albrecht Master, who also painted a prayerbook for Albrecht II, archduke of Austria 1404-39, king of Germany 1438-39 (ÖNB, Cod. 2722; Schmidt 2005, p. 452, fig. 6, and passim).

See also Ricketts 23. The Chertsey Breviary dates from the abbacy of John of Rotherwick. When complete, it had well over 500 leaves, with a Calendar, the Temporal, a ferial Psalter, and the Sanctoral. In the early nineteenth century, many of the prettiest initials, fragments of illuminated borders and a few whole leaves were cut out and were acquired by Francis Douce (1757-1834), who bequeathed them to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, where they were pasted into MS Douce d. 13 and MS Douce 381, fol. 126. (In September 1972, these mutilated pieces were removed and were remounted together in a separate small album, now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. d. 42.) In the meantime, 10 text leaves were offered for sale by Quaritch, Rough List 176 (1898), no. 7. They had been bound up re-using the sides of the manuscript’s sixteenth-century English panel-stamped binding. The fragment was bought by the Bodleian, where it is now MS Lat. liturg. e. 6. It includes most of the manuscript’s Calendar, with the anniversaries of the deaths of the abbots of Chertsey as far as Abbot Bartholomew, Rotherwick’s predecessor, who died on 15 July 1307. Since these entries are in the hand of the main scribe, they localise the manuscript and furnish a date of not earlier than 1307. The total of known leaves from the Breviary was first increased significantly in 1960 when 158 more leaves (one blank) were acquired by the Bodleian from Martin Breslauer, cat. 92 (1960), no. 28, from the estate of Wilfred Merton, who had himself bought them from Leighton in about 1914. These leaves are now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. e. 37. Seven years later, 160 more leaves of the manuscript emerged. They had belonged to William Matthews, c. 1825, and to Alexander Beresford-Hope (his sale, Sotheby’s, 23 March 1882, lot 167) and to Lord Saltoun, who acquired them after their sale at Sotheby’s, 29 June 1946, lot 108, and then re-sold them at Sotheby’s, 10 July 1967, lot 86, where they were bought by Major J. R. Abbey (his JA. 7397), who was then persuaded to re-sell his new acquisition to the Bodleian. These are now Bodleian MS Lat. liturg. e. 36. Thus, a total of 228 leaves as well as an album of cuttings are now all together in the Bodleian, in four portions with four different shelfmarks. This was the position when the Chertsey Breviary was published by Alexander 1974. Soon afterwards, however, 29 more leaves were discovered by James Marrow in the Gleeson Library, University of San Francisco (MS BX 2033 A 2), recognized and published by Sandler 1983 and, with a fuller account of the Bodleian pieces, by Sandler 1986, pp. 70-71, no. 62. Finally, the Lilly Library leaves were recognized as part of the Chertsey Breviary too, apparently first by Michael Michael and W. Gordon Wheeler, and they were described by J. R. Graver in 1988. Ricketts had bought them from two dealers, one of whom, Leighton, had also supplied and bound the Wilfred Merton fragment.|Bibliography: De Ricci 1935, pp. 621 and 625; J. R.

The historiated initials, with a picture for psalm 109 rather than psalm 101, conform to the pattern of table XI in Haseloff 1938, pp. 112-13.

When complete, it had well over 500 leaves, with a Calendar, the Temporal, a ferial Psalter, and the Sanctoral, all daintily illuminated in the general style of the Queen Mary Psalter (London, BL, Royal MS 2. B. vii). In the early nineteenth century, many of the prettiest initials, fragments of illuminated borders and a few whole leaves were cut out and were acquired by Francis Douce (1757-1834), who bequeathed them to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, where they were pasted into MS Douce d. 13 and MS Douce 381, fol. 126. (In September 1972, these mutilated pieces were removed and were remounted together in a separate small album, now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. d. 42.) In the meantime, 10 text leaves were offered for sale by Quaritch, Rough List 176 (1898), no. 7. They had been bound up re-using the sides of the manuscript’s sixteenth-century English panel-stamped binding. The fragment was bought by the Bodleian, where it is now MS Lat. liturg. e. 6. It includes most of the manuscript’s Calendar, with the anniversaries of the deaths of the abbots of Chertsey as far as Abbot Bartholomew, Rotherwick’s predecessor, who died on 15 July 1307. Since these entries are in the hand of the main scribe, they localise the manuscript and furnish a date of not earlier than 1307. The total of known leaves from the Breviary was first increased significantly in 1960 when 158 more leaves (one blank) were acquired by the Bodleian from Martin Breslauer, cat. 92 (1960), no. 28, from the estate of Wilfred Merton, who had himself bought them from Leighton in about 1914. These leaves are now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. e. 37. Seven years later, 160 more leaves of the manuscript emerged. They had belonged to William Matthews, c. 1825, and to Alexander Beresford-Hope (his sale, Sotheby’s, 23 March 1882, lot 167) and to Lord Saltoun, who acquired them after their sale at Sotheby’s, 29 June 1946, lot 108, and then re-sold them at Sotheby’s, 10 July 1967, lot 86, where they were bought by Major J. R. Abbey (his JA. 7397), who was then persuaded to re-sell his new acquisition to the Bodleian. These are now Bodleian MS Lat. liturg. e. 36. Thus, a total of 228 leaves as well as an album of cuttings are now all together in the Bodleian, in four portions with four different shelfmarks. This was the position when the Chertsey Breviary was published by Alexander 1974. Soon afterwards, however, 29 more leaves were discovered by James Marrow in the Gleeson Library, University of San Francisco (MS BX 2033 A 2), recognized and published by Sandler 1983 and, with a fuller account of the Bodleian pieces, by Sandler 1986, pp. 70-71, no. 62. Finally, the Lilly Library leaves were recognized as part of the Chertsey Breviary too, apparently first by Michael Michael and W. Gordon Wheeler, and they were described by J. R. Graver in 1988. Ricketts had bought them from two dealers, one of whom, Leighton, had also supplied and bound the Wilfred Merton fragment.|Bibliography: De Ricci 1935, pp. 621 and 625; J. R.

The volume in Bayeux is an unusual combination of a standard Missal supplemented by prayers and ceremonies for specific use by a bishop, such as ordinations, coronations and benedictions. The manuscript has two sequences of contemporary foliation, for the Temporal and the Sanctoral respectively. The manuscript in Bayeux is lacking about two dozen leaves. The four leaves here are listed among the manuscript’s losses in Leroquais 1937, I, pp. 72-73, and in the Catalogue Général, X, 1889, pp. 235-36; nine others (not including these) are described there as being at that time in the Mancel collection, at the Hôtel de Ville in Caen. Delisle 1887, p. 534, adds that ""il y en a un ou deux autres dans le cabinet d’un amateur de Bayeux perhaps the present leaves. They were bought by Ricketts in Paris. The Missal and Pontifical of Étienne de Loypeau is intimately connected with the circle of Jean, duc de Berry (1340-1416). Étienne de Loypeau had been a member of the duc’s household in Poitiers. This manuscript may have been commissioned by the duc de Berry for his protégé Étienne de Loypeau, in or soon after 1388. Étienne ordered a copy of his new manuscript, which he sent back to the duke, who gave it to the Sainte-Chapelle in Bourges. That copy survives as Paris, BnF, ms lat.8886, and it too is now incomplete. It includes two of the five miniatures copied from those on the Lilly leaves, the Holy Cross (fol. 440v) and Saint Michael (fol. 444v). Lat 8886 is the manuscript from which the ‘Luçon Master’, or ‘Master of Étienne Loypeau’, is now named, one of the important and prolific illuminators in the circle of the duc de Berry (Meiss 1974, pp. 351-52 and 393-97; Inès Villela-Petit in Taburet-Delahaye and Avril 2004, pp. 279-80, no. 171). The hand of the artist of the five Ricketts miniatures appears in many other very grand Parisian manuscripts of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, including aristocratic texts owned by Charles V and his brothers the dukes of Burgundy and Berry. The late Michael Camille named him as the ‘Master of Death’ and confidently identified him with Pierre Remiet, an illuminator recorded in Paris between 1368 and c. 1420 (Camille 1996). This thesis depends on the assumption that Pierre Remiet was the principal painter of a manuscript of the Pèlerinage de la vie humaine which includes the name of Remiet in a margin, BnF, ms fr. 823, fol. 18v. Probably, in fact, Remiet was no more than the Master’s assistant in that particular manuscript (cf. Rouse and Rouse 2000, I, pp. 293-95, and Manion 2005, p. 289, n. 15).

Occasionally, the instruction called for “ystoriata” but the initials actually painted are merely very large floral designs instead (e.g., fols. 136v and 157v). Exactly the same feature appears in the companion volume, Add. MS 30084. In that manuscript all fourteen of the illustrated initials are marked “ystoriata”, sometimes partly cropped, and 21 of the floral initials are marked “folia”, or close variants, including “foglia”, “foglo”, “fogla” and “foliata”.

Towards the end of his life, Pallavicini evidently commissioned a luxurious 2-volume illuminated manuscript Missal for the Sistine Chapel, shortly before Michelangelo began work there in 1508. The volume from which the Lilly fragments come was still being illuminated in or after 1506, since one of its borders included a roundel with a realistic picture of the Laocoon group, the famous classical statue excavated in Rome on 15 January 1506 (the border was Sotheby’s, 21 June 1988, lot 38, and is now destroyed).

The Maestro Daddesco was probably employed to illuminate new sets of choirbooks for the cathedral in the early 1330s, as part of the campaign of renewal following the translation of the relics of Saint Zenobius in 1331 (Tacconi 2000). Only four of the 23 choirbooks recorded in the possession of the cathedral sacristy in 1418 are still exant (ibid, p. 169, n. 29; cf. also Fabbri and Tacconi 1997, pp. 190–92, no. 66, and 216–17, no. 77).

Zanichelli 2001 and Bollati 2004, pp. 595–97). Tomasino may have been related to Guiniforte da Vimercate of Milan, the illuminator of the pattern-book of 1450 (Ricketts 40). With the Ricketts leaf, the eight known historiated initials show: fol. IIIr, Saint Bassiano (19 January, Lewis E M 72: 4); fol. Xv, the Presentation in the Temple (2 February, Lewis E M 72: 5); fol. XXVv, Saint Anthony of Padua (13 June, Lewis E M 72: 6); fol. XXVIIIr, the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist (24 June, the present leaf ); fol. XXXIv, Saints Peter and Paul (29 June, Lewis E M 72: 7); fol. LVIIIr, Saint Katherine (25 November, Lewis E M 72: 8); fol. LXIIIv, Common of apostles (Lewis E M 72: 9); and fol. LXXr, Common of one martyr (Lewis E M 72: 10).|One leaf: Latin.|One Leaf: The volume clearly comprised the Sanctoral and Common of Saints. The prominence given at the beginning to the very rare Saint Bassiano is notable. He was bishop of Lodi (d. 409) and patron saint of the cathedral there. The leaves are very likely therefore to be from the documented but lost set of choirbooks for Lodi cathedral ordered in 1395 by Fra Giorgio da Vimercate from the scribe Fazio de Castoldi, under the patronage of Bassiano da Glissate, prior of Lodi, an attribution entirely consistent with the stylistic date for the leaves (cf. Melograni 1995, p. 5, and Marubbi 1998, p. 162).","",2024-11-04 11:19:03 -0500,2011-11-06T01:55:32,ds_50_40_00153519.xml
