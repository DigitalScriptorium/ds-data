The name ""Jacobus de Rochis"" (or ""Rohis"") appears on a number of pages, and he may have been the leading spirit in the enterprise, although it does not appear that he was the author of all of the rubrics. He himself is quite obscure, and none of the standard catalogues, bibliographies, and encyclopedias mentions him. Probably this commentary has never been printed--since prelates were reluctant to allow every canonist to publish his own interpretation of canon law--and it is also possible that the work was intended as no more than an educational monastic exercise, a way of keeping the religious usefully and instructively occupied. The dating of the codex is problematic. The different hands all wrote in the traditional cramped Lombardic Gothic minuscule, with the conventional excessive use of abbreviations. There is little evidence in this codex of the influence of the rounded humanist minuscule script (which itself may be a sign of the traditional character of the scholarship of its authors). The watermark--three ""mounts"" and a cross--is of a very common type. Goodspeed, Descriptive catalogue, pages 39-41, and De Ricci, Census, volume 1, page 560, indicate only a 15th-century date. There are one or two indications that the codex may have originated later in the 15th century rather than earlier--although no certainty on these points seems possible.|Binding: 20th-century red library cloth over boards.|Owned by the Marquis of Taccone of Naples, who was treasurer to the king of Naples late in the 18th century.

There are about 180 capitals, at the heads of chapters, in brilliant gold bordered with blue and brown. The codex is rubricated throughout, and much use has been made of blue and red ink for paragraph signs and for listing the chapters at the beginning of each of the 10 parts. On the last leaf there is a drawing in color of an oak tree (unfinished) on which are hung six pairs of heraldic shields, and each shield has above it a helmet with the name of a distinguished family--Cleves, Blois, Des Barres, Florines, Strangort, Chauvegni, Pomponne, Montfort, Boulogne, Lessigniun, Mello, and Longuespee; at the top of the leaf are the royal arms of England and the word (divided) ""engle terre""; it has been surmised that this page may record some tournament between English and French knights early in the 14th century or before. On other pages a 14th-century owner has drawn his heraldic shield and the motto ""Avisiowel,"" which may, or may not, stand for ""Advise you well"" (i.e., beware) as written by a Frenchman or Anglo-Norman of about 1300. On a front leaf there is an elaborate illuminated heraldic device with the motto ""Nul autre espoir"" adn the drawing seems to be a variation of the coat-of-arms of Sir Thomas Garshall of Warwickshire, whose name appeared on one of the parliamentary rolls during the reign of Edward II (reigned 1307-1327)|Binding: 18th-century Dutch vellum over boards; yapp edges; faded manuscript title on spine.|Former owner's inscription on flyleaf: Sydney C.

The copy was made no earlier than 1576 (the date on the heading on fol. 1r), and possibly a good deal later. The paper contains a clear watermark of an uncommon type (a crossbow). An examination of the crossbow watermarks in Briquet (nos. 728-737) turns up one or two specimens that resemble that of the codex, but none that are identical. However, if Briquet is to be trusted, it would seem that the crossbow watermark was used by Northern Italian papermakers during a very short period, from about 1586 to about 1598; there are several papermakers in Venice, or in Venetia at large, who used the crossbow watermark during those years.|Shelfmark: Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Library, Ms779.|From the library of William Stirling Maxwell (his bookplate and armorial binding).

One of the earliest copies of this text, which was written approximately 1405.

The entire office for the feast of St. Mary of the Snows, ""in festo nivis,"" is included with the texts of the nine lessons.

The borders are executed in several different styles; the border on ff. 29v-30 is in a Renaissance style which includes swags in the upper and lower margins tied with cords, very similar to the ornament used by the Venetian Putti Master, who illuminated books for Nicolaus Jensen in the 1470s; the strewn flower borders show the influence of Ghent-Bruges illumination, a style adopted by Southern German artists early in the sixteenth century; this artist adapted this style to include not only flowers and leaves, but also naturalistic birds and animals, and small narrative scenes or other images.|Binding: 19th-century pink velvet over pasteboards; silver fittings c. 1900 that comprise a center piece of a putto embracing a lion on the front cover, a youth wearing a laurel wreath playing a harp on the back cover, and four putti attaching two pairs of clasps (clasps lost); flat spine; decorative endpapers in red with gilt ornament of floral tendrils surrounding a man holding a cat by the tail eyed by a dog (front endleaves), a harper and a nobleman with various birds including a peacock (back endleaves).|Origin: The manuscript was made for Erasmus Graf von Wolfstein (d. 1539), canon of Bamberg, c. 1535-1536, possibly in Bamberg itself, or elsewhere in Southern Germany. Erasmus is depicted in prayer with his coat of arms d'or, au deux lions de gueules on f. 25. The table for calculating the date of Easter (ff. 14v-15) begins with the year 1536, suggesting that the manuscript was copied then or in the previous year (the table is an original part of the manuscript).|Shelfmark: Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Library, Ms1717.|The last biographical note on f. 3v was added by a different hand in 1554. It mentions Augsburg. In addition to his position in Bamberg, Erasmus von Wolfstein was also a canon in Augsburg, and it is possible that he gave the manuscript to a canon there.
