Bulletin June 1968 says that Dr. John Plummer of the Pierpont Morgan Library identified the book as being from the School of the Master of the Golden Scrolls, active in Belgium, probably Bruges in the decade 1420-30, and suggests the addition of Saint Rupert in the calendar connects the book to Salzburg.
