Offered to, but refused by the Italian government, because of their false attribution of ownership to Petrarch. Bought by another Milanese bookdealer, Luigi Arrigoni; HM 1083 is n. 2 in his sale catalogue (1883). At Arrigoni's death (1886), the remaining Linterno codices acquired by J.

Belonged to the Welsh antiquary Robert Davies of Llannerch and Gwysaney (ca. 1658-1710). The earliest known catalogue of the Llannerch manuscripts, dated 1740, lists this manuscript as n. 14 (that number in ink on the front pastedown); the manuscript also appears in the 1778 catalogue as n. 69 (the cover of the manuscript has been rebacked, and thus probably lost its label with this designation). Later, when the collection had passed through inheritance to Philip Bryan Davies Cooke, a list of its contents was printed by the HMC, 6th Report , pt. I (1887-88); this manuscript on p. 419. When owned by Lt.-Col. Philip Ralph Davies-Cooke (b. 1896), the collection was placed on deposit in the National Library of Wales, 1947-59, where this book bore the number ""Gwysaney 19"" (in pencil on the inner front cover).

(f. 62v); ""Felbrygg"" scratched into the outer margin of f. 13v. The de la Pole and Cheyne obits in the calendar might be explained if the manuscript passed to Margaret's daughter Elizabeth, and after the latter's death to her husband Miles Stapleton's second wife, Katherine, daughter of Thomas de la Pole and Anne, née Cheyne. Owned, s. XV, by someone with a special veneration for Peter of Verona (feast added to calendar, and prayer added on f. 61v). Inscribed ""tout ma fiance"", perhaps a motto, written twice (f. 62v). Inscribed with a copy of ""An indenture or porcion of devyded among systers"" (sic), dated 12 July ""... in ye thyrde & forth yeares off ye reynes of sir philipe & marye ..."" i.e. 1556/7, appears to be initialed by the scribe ""P W"" and signed ""William Pax?er of the towne of Congleton within the county of Cheshire"" (f. 63r). This may perhaps relate to the fact that Simon Felbrigg had three daughters (Alana, Anne, and Elizabeth) by his marriage to Margaret, and no further offspring by his second marriage; Anne was the owner of the Felbrigge Psalter in the British Library (Sloane MS 2400), whose calendar includes the added obits of her parents Simon and Margaret. Inscribed ""L EAMES FAVELL""(?) (f. 10, upper margin). Inscribed, s. XIX, in purple pencil with a price and reference number ""£20/-/- 376(?)"" (front pastedown, upper left); and with brown ink price-codes(?) (front pastedown, upper right corner, and f. 1, upper left corner, both very indistinct). George Folliott (d. 1851), of Vicars Cross, Chester; ""sold by the joint direction of his daughter, Mrs. E. I. E. Folingsby Walker d. 1931 ... and her son James Folingsby Walker"" at Sotheby's, 12 May, 1930, lot 73, at which time it had 77 leaves and ""four full-page miniatures between the calendar and the beginning of the text, seven large historiated initials with full bar and scroll borders"", the miniatures representing Sts Margaret, Catherine, George, and the Crucifixion; ""In addition to these miniatures are three contemporary pen-and-ink drawings on fly-leaves, one a remarkable full-page pen drawing of St. Christopher"" (the latter is reproduced as a full-page plate in the catalog, but it represents John the Baptist with the Agnus dei, not Christopher); bought by ""Harris, T."" for £155, probably the dealer Tomás Harris (1908–64), of the Spanish Art Gallery, London, who was presumably responsible for removing the four full-page miniatures, historiated initials, and flyleaves with drawings (in addition to being an art dealer, Harris was an MI5 agent and was awarded the OBE in 1945; see ODNB). Inscribed in pencil, March 1946(?): ""Sarum Missal / Export Mar. '46"".

On f. 166 is another note in William Marshall's hand (without names); on f. 166v, a note in a different hand (the same as on f. 160, regarding the rent of a house) on the ""prosettes of Scavagyng gaderid by Robard Actun"" (Groom of the Chamber, 1524) and William Marshall, including the names of ""John More, the Cutlar nexte the flowiredeluse, Myghhell the Frutrare, John pachet, Rychard lyne, Thomas Alen, Nicolas krystin, Rychard Alen, John Bartun."" On f. 167, is another note headed ""william marshall"" and in his hand, referring to events of 14-17 December 1521 and mentioning ""John the Skot"" (possibly the Queen's tailor), ""mastar breges"" (John Brydges, Master of the Wardrobe in 1521 and 1530), ""Rogear otley"" (of the Pitchford family?), and ""nycolas slendon.""

Thomas miseracione divina""; a John Dolman was Yeoman of the Queen's Chamber in 1509-12; ""Master harrewood"" may be William Harwood, admitted to the Middle Temple in 1519.

Lat.bibl.b.4,include inscriptions of three 17th century Cheshire families: Richard Legh, 1613, and, on f. 46v, a donation note from Richard Dumville of Lyme in 1665 to the antiquary Sir Peter Leicester (1614-1678): ""Ex libris Petri Leicester de Nether-Tabley, qui liber mihi Dono datur a Richardo-Maria Dumvill de Limme Armigero, 27 die Martii, Anno domini 1665."" Eleven leaves were already missing by the time of Sir Peter's ownership according to his notes to that effect; it appears, however, that the bulk of the codex, comprising 413 leaves, survived intact until, or soon before, 1927, when it was evidently broken up by Myers and Co. of New Bond Street, London. Given to George A. Plimpton in June 1935 by the calligrapher Coella Lindsay Ricketts (1859-1941), who also gave leaves to the Newberry Library of Chicago (now MS Frag. 62.1-62.4) and to the Art Institute in Chicago (now Ace. no. 31.25); the leaves that Mr. Ricketts retained in his personal collection (De Ricci, p. 620 n. 15) are those now in the Lilly Library.

Owned by Richard Legh in 1613 (perhaps Richard Legh, b. 1549?, of East Hall, High Legh, Cheshire, or Richard Legh, b. 1554, of West Hall, High Legh): the last leaf of the parent volume, now Bodleian, MS. Lat. bib. b. 4, fol. 46v (formerly fol. 413v in the parent volume), is inscribed ""Rich(ard)us Legh me possidet Anno Dñi. 1613"" (the first four words repeated below, but crossed through in both cases). Richard Maria Domville (b. 1600 or 1603?, d. 1667), of Lymme Hall (about 2 miles from High Legh), eldest son and heir of Edward (d. 1639) and Eleanor (née Leycester). Sir Peter Leycester/Leicester (1614-78), antiquarian and historian (on whom see ODNB), of Nether Tabley (about 5 miles from High Legh), presented by Domville on 27 March 1665: below the Legh inscription on the Bodleian leaf is ""Ex libris Petri Leicester de Nether-Tabley: qui liber mihi Dono datur a Richardo Maria Dumvill de Limme Armigero, 27 die Martij, Anno Domini 1665"". The Bible appears in Sir Peter's library catalogue as follows: ""Part of a greate Latine Bible in Manuscript: a fayre character with greate Gold-Letters contayninge the Proverbs & all the Prophets, about the tyme of Henry VI, as I conjecture, it was writ. size: Largest Folio shelf: D:8 category: Divinity"" (Cheshire Record Office, DLT/B88, page 1). Inscribed on various leaves, noting losses of illuminated initials and whole leaves, e.g. ""The first chapter is torne out"" (Bodleian, fol. 1v), ""The beginning of the Canticles is torne out to the 6th verse of the second chapter"" (Bodleian, fol. 3r), ""The letter here basely cut out with some other wordes therewith"" (Bodleian, fol. 22v). The imperfect parent volume was apparently dismembered by Myers and Co., of New Bond St, London, in 1926/7; . Sold (with ff. 329 and 331) at Sotheby's, 21 June 1994, lot 19c; bought by Maggs for £2,070 including buyer's premium.

Manly and Rickert suggest that the note on f. 81 may be in the hand of William Thynne (d. 1546), who prepared editions of Chaucer's works in 1532 and 1542. The notes on ff. 1 and 9v appear to be written by John Stow (1525?-1605) who brought out a revised version of Thynne's edition of Chaucer in 1561; see E. P.

XIV, in London, Brit. Lib., Harley 460). After Charles Theyer's unsuccessful efforts to offer the books to Oxford University, they passed to the London bookseller Robert Scott. A catalogue compiled in 1678 (London, Brit. Lib., Royal Appendix 70) does not list Add. 10052-HM 112-Add. 10053; this collection was purchased by Charles II and passed with the Royal Library to the British Museum. The manuscript which is now Add. 10052, HM 112 and Add. 10053 may have been split up and bound separately by 1807, date of Richard Heber's purchase of Add. 10053 (since he purchased Add. 10052 only in 1819). HM 112 may have received its present binding while in the possession of George Offor (1787-1864), since the date of 1824 is on the paper flyleaves that contain an account of the text signed by Offor. It survived the fire at Sotheby's, 28 June 1865, although it is not one of the manuscripts listed for the first day's sale: 27 June 1865, lot 2666; the only signs of damage to HM 112 are dark stains on the edges of the front and back flyleaves, corresponding to the shape of the turn-ins. Belonged to Sir Thomas Brooke (1830-1908); see A Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Printed Books Collected by Thomas Brooke F.S.A. (London 1891) 1:253.

At the end of the century, ca. 1490, a later owner in the south of France added ff. 203-244 and had the illuminations of the first part retouched, sometimes extensively, by an artist whose style derived from that of Jean Colombe. This later owner's coat of arms, f. 203: or a tree proper fructed or on a chief azure a rose gules between 2 leaves (?) in pale or. His name may have been ""Julian,"" as that saint is invoked in the suffrage on f. 210, and the initial ""G"" appears in the prayers, ff. 216, 220, 224; the prayer on f. 218v reads ""…Sana me domine et libera me de isto languore B. et a presenti tribulatione G. ab omni infamia…"" Acquired ca. 1830 by Sir John Hayford Thorold of Syston Park; his book plate and monogrammed label on the front pastedown; his sale, Sotheby's, 12 December 1884, lot 965 to Quaritch; in the Quaritch General Catalogue 6 (1887) n. 35711, and in that firm's Hand-list (1890) n. 11.

De Marinis, La Biblioteca napoletana dei Re d'Aragona (Milan 1947-52) 1:66 identified the hand of this scribe with a Clemente Genovesi da Salerno mentioned in a Neapolitan document of 1487, who copied a ""Trattato di mascalcia,"" now lost. HM 1038 shares script, decoration and pocket-size format with several other manuscripts of classical texts, such as a Martial (formerly J. A. 3183, now belonging to B. S. Cron of Kew, England, Add. MS 7), an Ovid and a Virgil (Baltimore, Walters Art Museum, W. 385 and 400), a Florus (Vatican, Barb. lat. 7; signed), and a Tibullus and Virgil (Wolfenbüttel, Herzog-August Bibliothek 63.5 Aug. 8o; signed). This manuscript was apparently copied from the edition of Ovid printed by Hermann Liechtenstein in Vicenza, 1480 (Hain-Copinger 12141). Overall order is similar, in blocks: the printed text gives Heroides, the Sappho material, the Sabinus material, Amores, (here ff. 61-186v); Ars amatoria, De remedio amoris (here ff. 1-59v); Ibis, Fasti, De tristibus, Ex Ponto (not in this manuscript); Pulex, Philomena, Medicamina faciei, Nux, Ad Liviam (here ff. 187-203). De remedio amoris is divided into two books, both in the manuscript and in the 1480 edition. The 2 match in the presence or absence of supplemental material: two introductory couplets in the Heroides, the sections on Sappho and Sabinus, three responsory letters. They correspond in variant readings, in spellings (except for greater frequency of the diphthong ae in the printed text), and capitalization. The occasional incorrect initial in the manuscript (ff. 89, 168, 170, 180v) may be due to the fact that the initials were not printed in the 1480 edition, but left blank to be filled in by hand. This correspondence was first observed by M. D. Reeve.
