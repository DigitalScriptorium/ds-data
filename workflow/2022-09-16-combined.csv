The present pieces were in all probability similarly dismembered for use by the same bookbinder in London in the 1520s, and the slightly wavy text-side edge here so closely matches the corresponding edge of the once-adjacent Queens' College strip 2 that it is likely that they were cut with the same pull of the knife.|The script links the manuscript to a group of other surviving fragments all with texts by Ælfric.

It was seized by Pius II (1458-64), restored by Sixtus IV (1471-84), and purchased by Gregory XIII (1572-85). The manuscript might have passed through the papal library, which may explain the seventeenth-century spine title Psalterium Vaticanum but this could also mean no more than a superficial resemblance to other famous manuscripts in Beneventan minuscule from Montecassino now mostly in the Vatican Library. Several defective or partial leaves, edges worn. Many pages with old repairs using pieces from an eleventh-century liturgical manuscript in Beneventan minuscule and from a thirteenth-century legal manuscript. Lowe 1962 said that other pieces of this manuscript were in the Hayes Collection in Chicago, which is apparently an error (the Hayes Collection is now at the University of Colorado in Boulder, and no Beneventan leaves are known to have been part of it). There are, however, two other fragments in Beneventan minuscule in the Lilly Library, Ricketts 58 (F. 46), pieces from an early thirteenth-century Missal, and Ricketts 160 (F. 160), two leaves from Augus-tine on John, c. 1100, in script of the Bari type.|Other manuscripts written in Beneventan minuscule from San Domenico in Sora are Vatican, BAV, Cod. Reg. Lat. 334, and Oxford, Bodleian, MS Douce 127. Both invoke Saint Dominic in their litanies, fols. 31r and 118r respectively. It is likely that Poole 19 was made in Sora itself, although the late Virginia Brown noted that the hand looks more like that associated with the neighbouring region of Abruzzo, east of Sora, and the scribe may have trained elsewhere or was perhaps recruited for the monastery’s rededication in 1104.|Latin.|Includes canticles and litany.

The names of monks and hermits open with Saint Benedict, written in red, and they end with Saint Dominic. The women’s names conclude with Saints Restituta and Scholastica, sister of Saint Benedict. Dominic at this date cannot be the founder of the Black Friars (he was born in 1170 and was canonised in 1234). It must be Saint Dominic of Foligno (d. 1031), who founded the Benedictine abbey at Sora, in the province of Lazio between Rome and Naples, just within the border of Benevento. The abbey was reconsecrated by Pope Paschal II in 1104 and was dedicated to Saint Dominic. As Saint Restituta is the patron saint of the town of Sora, the manuscript was presumably made for the monastery.","",2022-09-16T16:08:10-04:00,2021-10-01,/Users/emeryr/code/upenn-libraries/ds-scripts/scripts/../data/digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/ds/indiana/mets/ds_50_40_00153477.xml

The arrangement of the pages, with successive column-width blocks of text, alternating the biblical (in large script) and the Gloss or commentary (in smaller script), is apparently unique among copies of Gilbert de la Porrée. It was invented around 1160 for Peter Lombard’s Magna glossatura (as in nos. 21 and 27 below), and so the manuscript here has the odd feature of being an archaic text in the format of its successor.|The use of gold is not characteristic of Cistercian book production, and the opulence of the manuscript is not typical of the manuscripts assumed to have been decorated in Cambron itself, as described by Glorieux-De Gand 1990b. The book is likely to have been made elsewhere, perhaps in France, and acquired by Cambron after it was written. Tiny sewing-holes beside and above the initials indicate that they were once protected by textile flaps. The large initial here shows an ostrich holding in its beak what appears to be a snake. The snake may be a visual misunderstanding of a horseshoe, with which ostriches were often shown in medieval heraldry, because they were reputed to eat iron. The unusual subject has a specific relevance to Philippians. The twelfth-century Bestiary text recounts that ostriches forget where they have laid their eggs. It explains this trait as being a symbol of the Christian who should forget earthly matters and focus instead on the prize of the higher calling, “ad bravium supernae vocationis”, in Latin (Barber 1999, p. 138). That is a direct quotation from Philippians 3: 14.|Latin.|The leaf opens in the biblical reading for Ephesians 6: 7, followed by the prologue to Philippians (Stegmüller no. 728) and the text of Philippians to 1: 4, all interspersed with the Media glossatura.

B. vii). In the early nineteenth century, many of the prettiest initials, fragments of illuminated borders and a few whole leaves were cut out and were acquired by Francis Douce (1757-1834), who bequeathed them to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, where they were pasted into MS Douce d. 13 and MS Douce 381, fol. 126. (In September 1972, these mutilated pieces were removed and were remounted together in a separate small album, now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. d. 42.) In the meantime, 10 text leaves were offered for sale by Quaritch, Rough List 176 (1898), no. 7. They had been bound up re-using the sides of the manuscript’s sixteenth-century English panel-stamped binding. The fragment was bought by the Bodleian, where it is now MS Lat. liturg. e. 6. It includes most of the manuscript’s Calendar, with the anniversaries of the deaths of the abbots of Chertsey as far as Abbot Bartholomew, Rotherwick’s predecessor, who died on 15 July 1307. Since these entries are in the hand of the main scribe, they localise the manuscript and furnish a date of not earlier than 1307. The total of known leaves from the Breviary was first increased significantly in 1960 when 158 more leaves (one blank) were acquired by the Bodleian from Martin Breslauer, cat. 92 (1960), no. 28, from the estate of Wilfred Merton, who had himself bought them from Leighton in about 1914. These leaves are now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. e. 37. Seven years later, 160 more leaves of the manuscript emerged. They had belonged to William Matthews, c. 1825, and to Alexander Beresford-Hope (his sale, Sotheby’s, 23 March 1882, lot 167) and to Lord Saltoun, who acquired them after their sale at Sotheby’s, 29 June 1946, lot 108, and then re-sold them at Sotheby’s, 10 July 1967, lot 86, where they were bought by Major J. R. Abbey (his JA. 7397), who was then persuaded to re-sell his new acquisition to the Bodleian. These are now Bodleian MS Lat. liturg. e. 36. Thus, a total of 228 leaves as well as an album of cuttings are now all together in the Bodleian, in four portions with four different shelfmarks. This was the position when the Chertsey Breviary was published by Alexander 1974. Soon afterwards, however, 29 more leaves were discovered by James Marrow in the Gleeson Library, University of San Francisco (MS BX 2033 A 2), recognized and published by Sandler 1983 and, with a fuller account of the Bodleian pieces, by Sandler 1986, pp. 70-71, no. 62. Finally, the Lilly Library leaves were recognized as part of the Chertsey Breviary too, apparently first by Michael Michael and W. Gordon Wheeler, and they were described by J. R. Graver in 1988.

It includes most of the manuscript’s Calendar, with the anniversaries of the deaths of the abbots of Chertsey as far as Abbot Bartholomew, Rotherwick’s predecessor, who died on 15 July 1307. Since these entries are in the hand of the main scribe, they localise the manuscript and furnish a date of not earlier than 1307. The total of known leaves from the Breviary was first increased significantly in 1960 when 158 more leaves (one blank) were acquired by the Bodleian from Martin Breslauer, cat. 92 (1960), no. 28, from the estate of Wilfred Merton, who had himself bought them from Leighton in about 1914. These leaves are now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. e. 37. Seven years later, 160 more leaves of the manuscript emerged. They had belonged to William Matthews, c. 1825, and to Alexander Beresford-Hope (his sale, Sotheby’s, 23 March 1882, lot 167) and to Lord Saltoun, who acquired them after their sale at Sotheby’s, 29 June 1946, lot 108, and then re-sold them at Sotheby’s, 10 July 1967, lot 86, where they were bought by Major J. R. Abbey (his JA. 7397), who was then persuaded to re-sell his new acquisition to the Bodleian. These are now Bodleian MS Lat. liturg. e. 36. Thus, a total of 228 leaves as well as an album of cuttings are now all together in the Bodleian, in four portions with four different shelfmarks. This was the position when the Chertsey Breviary was published by Alexander 1974. Soon afterwards, however, 29 more leaves were discovered by James Marrow in the Gleeson Library, University of San Francisco (MS BX 2033 A 2), recognized and published by Sandler 1983 and, with a fuller account of the Bodleian pieces, by Sandler 1986, pp. 70-71, no. 62. Finally, the Lilly Library leaves were recognized as part of the Chertsey Breviary too, apparently first by Michael Michael and W. Gordon Wheeler, and they were described by J. R. Graver in 1988. Ricketts had bought them from two dealers, one of whom, Leighton, had also supplied and bound the Wilfred Merton fragment.|The initials for psalms 38, 68 and 80, which were part of this section, are on Bodleian MS Lat. liturg. d. 42, fols. 22–24.

D). Maestro Daddesco and his workshop clearly specialised in choirbooks, many of which became casualties of knife-wielding collectors of miniatures during the nineteenth century. Excised initials intimately related to the Ricketts cutting are scattered around the world (Boskovits 1984, pp. 220–50, plates LXXXIV– XCIX; Kanter and Boehm 1994, pp. 106–15; Hindman 1997, pp. 156–61; Palladino 2003, pp. 44–45, no. 24; etc.). The Ricketts cutting is especially close to initials from an Antiphoner showing various saints, acquired in Florence in 1837 by James Dennistoun (1803–1855), lot 80 in Lord Clark’s sale, Sotheby’s, 3 July 1984 (afterwards BEL, cat. 2, 1998, pp. 12–15, and Zeileis 2004, pp. 188–89, no. 61), which Dennistoun said were cut from the choirbooks of Santa Maria del Fiore, the cathedral (or duomo) of Florence. The Maestro Daddesco was probably employed to illuminate new sets of choirbooks for the cathedral in the early 1330s, as part of the campaign of renewal following the translation of the relics of Saint Zenobius in 1331 (Tacconi 2000). Only four of the 23 choirbooks recorded in the possession of the cathedral sacristy in 1418 are still exant (ibid, p. 169, n. 29; cf. also Fabbri and Tacconi 1997, pp. 190–92, no. 66, and 216–17, no. 77).

The Lewis cutting, in turn, is ascribed by Pia Palladino to the artist of a cutting in the Lehman collection in New York, bought from Olschki in Florence in 1924 (Palladino 2003, p. 31, no. 16).

The volume in Bayeux is an unusual combination of a standard Missal supplemented by prayers and ceremonies for specific use by a bishop, such as ordinations, coronations and benedictions. The manuscript has two sequences of contemporary foliation, for the Temporal and the Sanctoral respectively. The manuscript in Bayeux is lacking about two dozen leaves. The four leaves here are listed among the manuscript’s losses in Leroquais 1937, I, pp. 72-73, and in the Catalogue Général, X, 1889, pp. 235-36; nine others (not including these) are described there as being at that time in the Mancel collection, at the Hôtel de Ville in Caen. Delisle 1887, p. 534, adds that ""il y en a un ou deux autres dans le cabinet d’un amateur de Bayeux perhaps the present leaves. They were bought by Ricketts in Paris. The Missal and Pontifical of Étienne de Loypeau is intimately connected with the circle of Jean, duc de Berry (1340-1416). Étienne de Loypeau had been a member of the duc’s household in Poitiers. This manuscript may have been commissioned by the duc de Berry for his protégé Étienne de Loypeau, in or soon after 1388. Étienne ordered a copy of his new manuscript, which he sent back to the duke, who gave it to the Sainte-Chapelle in Bourges. That copy survives as Paris, BnF, ms lat.8886, and it too is now incomplete. It includes two of the five miniatures copied from those on the Lilly leaves, the Holy Cross (fol. 440v) and Saint Michael (fol. 444v). Lat 8886 is the manuscript from which the ‘Luçon Master’, or ‘Master of Étienne Loypeau’, is now named, one of the important and prolific illuminators in the circle of the duc de Berry (Meiss 1974, pp. 351-52 and 393-97; Inès Villela-Petit in Taburet-Delahaye and Avril 2004, pp. 279-80, no. 171). The hand of the artist of the five Ricketts miniatures appears in many other very grand Parisian manuscripts of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, including aristocratic texts owned by Charles V and his brothers the dukes of Burgundy and Berry. The late Michael Camille named him as the ‘Master of Death’ and confidently identified him with Pierre Remiet, an illuminator recorded in Paris between 1368 and c. 1420 (Camille 1996). This thesis depends on the assumption that Pierre Remiet was the principal painter of a manuscript of the Pèlerinage de la vie humaine which includes the name of Remiet in a margin, BnF, ms fr. 823, fol. 18v. Probably, in fact, Remiet was no more than the Master’s assistant in that particular manuscript (cf. Rouse and Rouse 2000, I, pp. 293-95, and Manion 2005, p. 289, n. 15). This does not alter the fact that the unnamed Master of Death was the painter of a substantial number of major royal and noble manuscripts, which increases the likelihood, first hinted at by Delisle 1887, that the duc de Berry himself commissioned the Missal, from which the Lilly leaves are an unexpected survival.|The hand of the artist of the five Ricketts miniatures appears in many other very grand Parisian manuscripts of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, including aristocratic texts owned by Charles V and his brothers the dukes of Burgundy and Berry.

XLIX in the Sanctoral, ""Benedicite dominum omnes angeli . . ."", the introit for Michaelmas (29 September), to the secret for that Mass ""Donis celestibus . . . mente inservire ut"", with the miniature on the recto; and (d) fol.

(John 1: 41), on the vigil of Saint Andrew (29 November) and the feast itself on the 30th, as far as the benediction, ""Det vobis . . . andreas non ti"", with the miniature on the recto. A small point of interest in the first leaf is that the Passion narrative is marked up in red for public performance, with three speakers’ parts indicated in red with ‘+’, ‘c’ and ‘s’.

Zanichelli 2001 and Bollati 2004, pp. 595–97). Tomasino may have been related to Guiniforte da Vimercate of Milan, the illuminator of the pattern-book of 1450 (Ricketts 40).
